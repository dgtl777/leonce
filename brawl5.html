        <p><b><i>COMMON BRAWLERS</i></b></p><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p>Shelly: <br><br><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3b/7a/d2/3b7ad273bb54a6eb2d4236a55435123e.jpg" alt=""><br><br>Shelly is a Common Brawler that is unlocked upon beginning the game. She has moderate health and damage output. Her shotgun deals more damage the closer she is to her target, making her excellent for short combat. Her attacks have a wide spread as well. Her Super can clear several obstacles and will also knock back enemy Brawlers, similarly dealing more damage at close range. Her first Gadget, Fast Forward, allows her to dash a few tiles in the direction she is facing. Her second Gadget, Clay Pigeons, narrows the width and increases the range of her next shot. Her first Star Power, Shell Shock, makes her Super momentarily slow down enemies. Her second Star Power, Band-Aid, gives her a bar that charges over a time of 15 seconds and, when fully charged, resets and heals her when her health falls below 40%.
                Attack: Buckshot
                "Shelly's boomstick fires a wide spread of pellets to a medium range. The more pellets hit, the greater the damage."
                
                Shelly fires a burst of shells that deal rather low damage by themselves, but deals a lot of together. The attack is more effective at close range since more of the shells will hit the enemy, but the range of her attack is quite far. This allows Shelly to excel in close-quarters combat, especially against Brawlers with lower health and/or short-ranged attacks.
                Super: Super Shell
                "Shelly's Super Shell obliterates both cover and enemies. Any survivors get knocked back."
                
                Shelly's Super fires a damaging burst of shells which can not only destroy obstacles but also knock back enemy Brawlers. It is similar to her main attack in that the shells spread out, and deals massive damage at close range.
                Gadgets
                Fast Forward
                "Shelly dashes ahead, skipping a few unnecessary steps!"
                
                Shelly dashes 3.33 tiles in the direction she is facing when she uses this Gadget. Dashing into walls or water will cut the dash short.
                Clay Pigeons
                "On activation, Shelly's next main attack focuses the fire to a smaller area and increases the range."
                
                Shelly's next main attack will have its spread decreased by one third and its range increased to 10 tiles. A Gadget symbol will glow above Shelly's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after this attack is shot.
                Star Powers
                Shell Shock
                "Shelly's Super shells slow down enemies for 4.5 seconds!"
                
                Enemies hit by Shelly's Super Shell are slowed down by a considerable amount for 4.5 seconds.
                Band-Aid
                "When Shelly falls below 40% health, she instantly heals for 2000 health. Band-Aid recharges in 15.0 seconds."
                
                Shelly gains a bar similar to Bibi's Home Run bar, which takes 15 seconds to charge completely. If Shelly falls below 40% health, she instantly heals for 2000 health, and the bar resets. However, if Shelly has over 40% health and gets defeated in one blow by a high-damage Brawler like Bull, her Star Power will not activate, and she will have to wait another 15 seconds to get Band-Aid back after respawning, regardless of if it was charged or not. The amount of health healed from Band-Aid is not affected by Showdown Power Cubes.
                Tips
                
                    Shelly is great in maps with lots of bushes and walls. However, be careful when using her Super, as it does destroy walls and bushes, which could prove fatal to teammates if they need the cover to hide behind.
                    The spread on Shelly's attacks allows her to sweep bushes and expose any enemies hiding in them.
                    Take advantage of walls when approaching long-range enemy Brawlers, such as Colt or Rico (for Rico, try to avoid having a large assortment of walls by and behind you that he could bounce his projectiles on), since they can out-range and take down Shelly with ease in the open.
                    Shelly is an excellent counter to El Primo and other heavyweights besides Bull or Darryl. Shelly out-damages El Primo and can knock him back with her Super if things get fierce. This can also be used to push him away from your base/IKE in Heist or Siege. Darryl and Bull can easily defeat Shelly as they have more damage than her and their shotgun mechanics too allow them to deal damage quickly. For these two Brawlers, chip away at their health at long range until you use your Super and kill them when they're on low health (more effective if you dash into them with Fast Forward).
                    Defeating assassins with Shelly can be tricky, especially with long-ranged assassins such as Crow and Stu who deal equal damage regardless of range while Shelly can’t deal much damage at a range. Even close-ranged assassins like Edgar and Mortis can counter Shelly, because their speed can help them strafe away from the majority of the fire, and Mortis’s dashes and Edgar’s Super can be utilized to evade your Super, plus, Edgar and Mortis have powerful survivability with Edgar’s healing and Mortis’s Super. Leon may also auto-aim all his ammo onto her, which can defeat her. To defeat such Brawlers, use your Fast Forward Gadget to get closer to the long-ranged assassins and defeat them at close quarters, however, this is circumvented if the respective assassin escapes, such as Stu’s dash. For close-ranged assassins, focus on landing your shots correctly to quickly defeat them.
                    Shelly's Clay Pigeons Gadget can be used directly after using her Super at mid-range. While the enemy gets knocked back, Shelly is able to hit all bullets with her Gadget to provide maximum value.
                    Shelly is moderately good in Brawl Ball. She can destroy walls blocking the enemy's goal and allow your team to score more easily. A tactic some people use is shooting the ball and immediately using her Super to break any obstacles that can block the ball from getting into the goal, surprising the defending enemies.
                    Shelly's Super has the ability to interrupt other Brawlers' Supers because it knocks them back. For example, she can stop Frank from using his Super if she hits him with her Super during his wind-up. This can be made more deadly by waiting in a bush and ambushing.
                    Shelly is capable of chaining her Super. This is done by using her Super against an enemy Brawler at point-blank range. This will charge her Super such that she needs only one more main attack to have her Super ready again, allowing her to move on to the next Brawler to repeat the process, gaining and using Supers in quick succession. This proves to be an effective counter against tanks except for Bull and Darryl.
                    Using her Shell Shock Star Power, she can slow down Brawlers trying to escape, allowing her and/or her teammates to catch up and eliminate them.
                    In Duo Showdown, there are a lot of useful team combinations, like the Shelly and Tara team and the Shelly and Gene team. If Tara uses her Super to drag enemies toward her, Shelly (with Super) can advance toward the disabled enemies and use her Super. As for Gene and Shelly, if Gene pulls the enemy Brawler towards Shelly, Shelly can use her Super to defeat the enemy.
                    If Shelly is at low health and is being chased by a Brawler, she can use her Super to knock back the Brawler and gain a bit more time to escape. This works even better if she has Shell Shock since that way, she can also slow them down for a few seconds.
                    Shelly's Clay Pigeons Gadget channels her shot making it easier to charge Supers. In mirror matches or against medium-ranged Brawlers this can be helpful, but her Fast Forward Gadget gives Shelly more opportunities. It allows her to get in close range to enemies and ambush them, potentially surprising enemies if she dashes from a bush. Sometimes though, you will find yourself using Clay Pigeons in situations where an enemy on low health is out of your normal range and you desperately need to finish them off (like when they have a countdown or you need just a few stars in Bounty).
                    In Duo Showdown, if you have a teammate with ranged jumps, dashes or charges like El Primo with his jump, you can charge up your Super and then get defeated. Then, when you are just about to respawn, your teammate can get near an enemy team with their ability so that you respawn next to the enemies. Then, use your Super to defeat them, chaining Supers if needed. Your post-spawn immunity will protect you while you do this. If your teammate is a squishier Brawler like Crow, they may jump slightly further away from the enemy and you can use your Fast Forward Gadget to get near to the enemy. Timing is vital in this, because if your teammate jumps too early or late it can either become useless or fatal. However, if timed and aimed correctly, this will result in a team-wipe as it works well regardless of the number of Power Cubes the enemy has. Do not use this against Brawlers like Darryl or Bull as they can charge or roll away from you, respectively, before you respawn.
                    Shelly can slow down the entire enemy team with her Shell Shock Star Power, making way for a potential team wipe with the help of allies that can deal splash damage. In Showdown, this can be used to catch up with longer-range Brawlers if they get hit by her super. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                Nita: <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/3/36/Nita_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20200829210549" alt=""> Nita is a Common Brawler that is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 10 Trophies. She has moderate health and attacks with shockwaves that have moderate range and can hit multiple enemies. She is most notable for her Super's ability to summon "Bruce", a bear that has high health and quick, dangerous melee attacks. Her first Gadget, Bear Paws, will briefly stun all enemies in an area around her Bear. Her second Gadget, Faux Fur, shields her Bear for a brief amount of time. Her first Star Power, Bear with Me, slightly heals her bear when she herself attacks an enemy, and Nita slightly heals when her bear attacks an enemy. Her second Star Power, Hyper Bear, increases the attack speed of her bear.
                Attack: Rupture
                "Nita sends forth a shockwave, damaging enemies caught in the tremor."
                
                Nita releases a shockwave that deals low damage but reloads very fast. It has moderate range, and the shockwave is fairly wide, but it does not spread out as it travels. The shockwave can pierce and hit multiple enemies.
                Super: Overbearing
                "Nita summons the spirit of Big Baby Bear to hunt down her enemies."
                
                Nita summons a bear to chase down and damage enemies. The bear walks towards the nearest enemy even if they are in a bush and attempts to hit them with quick melee attacks that does considerable damage. The bear shares the same above average health with Nita.
                Gadgets
                Bear Paws
                "Nita commands her bear to slam the ground, stunning all enemies within its reach."
                
                After a 1 second delay, Nita's bear will stun enemies for 0.5 seconds within a 3.33 tile radius of it, allowing it to catch up to and attack them when this Gadget is used. The Gadget can only be used while Nita has a bear from her Super within 12 tiles of her current location on the map.
                Faux Fur
                "For the next 3.0 seconds, Nita's bear gets a 35% shield against damage."
                
                Nita's bear will be shielded from attacks by 35% for 3 seconds. This is slightly more protective than most other shielding abilities; however it is applied onto a mobile spawnable. The Gadget can only be used while Nita has a bear from her Super within 12 tiles of her current location on the map.
                Star Powers
                Bear with Me
                "Nita recovers 800 health whenever her bear hits an enemy. When Nita deals damage, her bear regains 800 health."
                
                This passive ability allows Nita to heal herself and her bear to heal her when they attack enemies respectively. The healing can be maximized by throwing the bear into a large group of Brawlers so it lands more hits to heal Nita. Likewise, Nita can also join in the fight to keep her bear alive for longer, similar to Jessie's Energize Star Power in healing her turret. The effects can be seen even when Nita and Bruce are inside a bush or hidden. Nita nor Bruce won’t heal from attacking spawnables.
                Hyper Bear
                "Nita's bear attacks faster. Time between swipes is reduced by 60%."
                
                This allows Nita's bear to deal damage 2.5 times as fast as it usually would. This makes it an immediate threat to standing enemies and other minions.
                Tips
                
                    Nita's attack can hit multiple enemies from a fair distance away. Take advantage of this when enemies gather close together.
                    Nita's Super can be thrown over walls, so it can come in handy for dealing with enemies that are hiding behind one.
                    The bear summoned by Nita's Super has high health, allowing Nita to create her own tank. The bear distracts enemies and absorbs fire, protecting Nita and giving her a chance to deal damage.
                    The bear she summons can also detect Brawlers hidden in bushes and pursue them. This can help the player locate hiding enemy Brawlers, effectively making it a scouting tool helping you and your teammates.
                    Since Nita's Super is a thrown projectile like Barley's attacks, it will summon the bear quicker if thrown toward an area closer to Nita. This is convenient when you are being attacked by a shotgun-wielding Brawler such as Shelly or Bull since the bear can tank the projectiles, allowing Nita to escape and counterattack.
                    Nita's bear has a very short attack range, so it is best if supported or used in an enclosed area where the enemy will be unable to get past the bear.
                    Nita can use her Super to spawn the bear on a launch pad to ambush unsuspecting enemy Brawlers.
                    Avoid hiding behind her bear when facing a Penny since the splash attack will have a huge effect on Nita.
                    When facing a Frank, throw her bear right behind the Frank. That way, he has to move or attack from 2 angles, making it easier to take him down.
                    Use Nita's Super to bolster an aggressive push on Gem Grab, allowing your team to take control of the mine.
                    The bear is useful in both Siege and Heist where you can throw the bear past enemies and walls to attack either the safe or IKE turret. In Siege, the bear can add lots of damage when attacking alongside a robot and defending against a robot. Nita's Hyper Bear Star Power is especially useful in these modes.
                    If she ever gets too close to melee Brawlers, use her Super to distract heavyweights like Darryl or Bull so there is ample time to escape.
                    Nita’s Bear Paws Gadget can come into great effect if you have her Hyper Bear Star Power. Nita will be able to stun enemies and charge her Super again extremely fast, which can be useful against high-health Brawlers. However, it also works with her Bear with Me Star Power, allowing the bear to catch up to enemies and heal Nita more.
                    Faux Fur's shield greatly increases Bear with Me's effectiveness. In Heist, using it with her Hyper Bear Star Power may be more favorable. In general, only use Hyper Bear in non-Heist modes when she is using Bear Paws. Bear with Me provides more consistent value in these cases.
                    When facing an enemy Frank, always have the Bear Paws Gadget ready to cancel Frank’s Super when he’s about to stun you, Bruce, and your teammates. This will not only cancel Frank’s Super in the process, therefore defusing it, but also give ample time for teammates to defeat Frank.
                    When facing a Brawler with non-piercing attacks, place Bruce a few tiles (or right in front of you) to make them waste their ammo on Bruce, while you and Bruce can effectively finish them off. <br><br><br><br><br>
                    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/8/8a/Colt_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20200228072554" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
                    Colt is a Common Brawler who is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 60 Trophies. He has low health but a high damage output. His attack is a burst of six long-ranged bullets. His Super is very similar to his attack, but it fires an extra-long volley of twelve bullets that can destroy obstacles and pierce through enemies. His first Gadget, Speedloader, instantly reloads 2 ammo in his ammo bar. His second Gadget, Silver Bullet, turns his next attack into a single piercing bullet that deals the damage of two of his main attack’s bullets and destroys obstacles. His first Star Power, Slick Boots, increases his movement speed, and his second Star Power, Magnum Special, increases his main attack's range and bullet speed.
                    Attack: Six-Shooters
                    "Colt shoots six straight long-range shots out of his revolvers."
                    
                    Colt shoots out a straight volley of six bullets. Their long range can pick off distant enemies. Each bullet by itself does little damage, but a whole volley hitting an enemy can deal high burst damage. The attack takes 0.75 seconds to complete.
                    Super: Bullet Storm
                    "Colt rattles off a massive burst of bullets that shoot extra far and destroy cover."
                    
                    Colt fires an extra-long volley of twelve bullets. These bullets appear larger in size, have a considerably longer range, and have the ability to destroy obstacles and pierce through enemies. Note that a bullet that destroys a wall tile is destroyed as well. The Super takes 1.35 seconds to complete.
                    Gadgets
                    Speedloader
                    "Colt instantly reloads 2 ammo."
                    
                    When Colt's Gadget is used, he reloads 2 ammo instantly. Other ammo won’t be interrupted from reloading. If Colt already has full ammo, the Gadget can’t be used, but it can be used even if Colt only has one unfilled ammo bar.
                    Silver Bullet
                    "Colt's next attack is one powerful shot that deals as much damage as 2 of his regular bullets, while going through obstacles and opponents alike."
                    
                    When Colt's Gadget is activated, his next attack fires a single bullet which deals the damage of two normal bullets and pierces through enemies. In addition, it can pierce through obstacles, breaking all obstacles in its path. Colt's Magnum Special Star Power affects the range of this Gadget. A Gadget symbol will glow above Colt's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after this attack is shot.
                    Star Powers
                    Slick Boots
                    "Colt's movement speed is increased by 13%."
                    
                    Colt's movement speed is increased by 13%, allowing him to move faster than most other Brawlers and the same as assassins such as Crow and Leon.
                    Magnum Special
                    "Colt's attack range and bullet speed are increased by 11%."
                    
                    Colt's attack range is increased by almost 1 tile, making his range almost equal to Piper and Brock. The bullet speed is also increased to reach the target in the same amount of time at maximum range as normal. This doesn’t affect his Super range.
                    Tips
                    
                        Try to keep your distance. Colt specializes in long-ranged combat and can out-range short-ranged Brawlers very easily.
                        Try to follow the enemy's movement. The full potential of your attack requires all six of your bullets to hit the enemy. Predicting the enemy's movement allows all six of your bullets to hit and deals massive damage. If they dodge a lot, shoot behind them so that they walk into your bullets. The inverse also works; If they keep walking into your attack when you use prediction to shoot, just keep shooting that way.
                        Colt's Super can be used to devastate enemies directly or can be used to destroy enemy cover so his teammates can rush in and finish off the enemies. In addition, his Super could also be used to prevent enemies from passing through an area for a brief period of time.
                        You’ll want to use Colt on more open maps, where he can gain map control effectively, out-ranging many Brawlers with his attacks. His Magnum Special Star Power is also more effective when in open spaces, as it gives him additional range and therefore increases his area of control.
                        Colt's Slick Boots allows him to move faster, making chasing or escaping to cover easier. Slick Boots is also excellent for dodging projectiles from long-ranged enemies.
                        In Brawl Ball, if the goal still has 2 blocks on the ends, or any goal walls are still present, you can kick the ball into the wall, then immediately use your Super or Silver Bullet to break the walls, enabling the Ball to go through the goal with the new open space.
                        Colt’s Speedloader Gadget can be extremely useful when attacking the enemy safe in Heist. The additional ammo it provides can deal high damage even when Colt is out of ammo and potentially hinder the enemy team. Colt's Speedloader Gadget is also helpful in Siege either to eliminate an enemy Siege Bot quickly or to deal massive damage to the IKE turret.
                        In Duo Showdown and other team modes, it's useful to play Colt with Brawlers with stunning and slowing abilities to make it easier to hit all of his bullets.
                        When being attacked by a Mortis, try to keep moving to one direction and shooting to the exact opposite way Colt is facing. Because Mortis lands slightly behind or in Colt with his attack, he has to follow him with subsequent attacks if Colt keeps moving the same way, making him run into all bullets.
                        While Colt’s Speedloader passively gives you multiple times the damage of Silver Bullet, it is hard to hit all bullets even at close range, as Silver Bullet, in addition to clearing the landscape, essentially guarantees a hit in close quarters or allows to ambush and surprise the enemy by clearing obstacles. Therefore, if you can hit most shots consistently, for example in highly restricted maps or against stationery or slow targets, Speedloader is a better choice as you can benefit from 2 nearly full shots over Silver Bullet, which grants you less damage for one ammo.
                        Silver Bullet can be used to clear objects such the walls around the goal in Brawl Ball. In Showdown, he can also use Silver Bullet to destroy obstacles and finish off low-health Brawlers, especially throwers who are hiding and attacking you from behind obstacles. <br><br><br><br><br>

                        Bull is a Common Brawler who is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 250 Trophies. Bull has high health, an above-average movement speed, and a high damage potential. He has a Trait that allows him to charge his Super from enemies damaging him. His attack is a shot of multiple shells that deal high damage up close. His Super makes him charge in a certain direction, damaging enemies and destroying obstacles in his way, allowing him to get closer to or escape from enemies. His first Gadget, T-Bone Injector, instantly heals him for a considerable amount. His second Gadget, Stomper, halts his Super and stomps on the ground, slowing enemies within range. His first Star Power, Berserker, doubles his reload speed when he falls below 60% health. His second Star Power, Tough Guy, shields him when he falls below 40% health.

                        Trait
                        "This Brawler charges Super from damage received."
                        
                        Whenever Bull takes damage from an enemy Brawler, he will charge his Super. The Super charge rate depends on the damage the enemy deals. It takes 20000 damage to charge a Super completely, and all damage is calculated after shielding and other effects.
                        Attack: Double-Barrel
                        "Bull's double-barreled shotgun deals heavy damage. It has very short range, so Bull likes to get up close and personal."
                        
                        Bull fires a burst of 5 shotgun shells that deal little damage by themselves. However, if all of Bull's shells hit, they can deal very high damage. The range of Bull's attack is much shorter than Shelly's, but Bull's shells deal much more damage. The attack deals more damage at close-range since more shells are likely to hit the enemy.
                        Super: Bulldozer
                        "Bull puts his head down and bulldozes through opponents and obstacles. He's always been headstrong!"
                        
                        Bull charges forward a long distance in the direction he aims his Super. He destroys obstacles he charges into, and knocks back and damages enemies in his path. Note that Bull can still take damage while using Bulldozer, unlike airborne abilities. If his final destination is in the middle of a lake, his charging distance increases to the closest ground. Knockback effects won’t affect his Super, but stuns will.

                        When Bull's Gadget is used, he instantly heals 1500 health, but halts the self-regeneration process. This Gadget can’t be used when Bull is at full health.
                        Stomper
                        "Bull can interrupt his Super charge and slow all nearby opponents with a massive stomp for 1.5 seconds."
                        
                        Bull can choose to immediately interrupt his Super's charge by a stomp which slows enemies caught in a 4 tile radius around him for 1.5 seconds. This can only be used during his Super and cancels the Super upon use.

                        When Bull’s health falls below 60% of its maximum, he turns red and his reload speed will double. The effect is lost if Bull heals back above 60% health.
                        Tough Guy
                        "When Bull falls below 40% health, he gains a shield that reduces all damage he takes by 30%."
                        
                        When Bull's health falls below than 40% of its maximum, he gains a damage reduction shield that reduces 30% of all damage he takes. The effect is lost if Bull heals back above 40% health. This gives him a total health potential of 8200 without any outside health buffs.
                        Tips
                        
                            Bull can deal a lot of damage when he’s within close-quarters of his target and has high health, but can’t deal maximum damage when he isn’t close. Take advantage of bushes, obstacles, or thin choke points to ambush and defeat enemies. Note that Bull is visible in bushes when using his Super. Therefore, in more open areas or maps, try to dodge enemy attacks. Bull has a higher movement speed than most Brawlers so he can rush enemies and avoid their attacks more easily. It’s ideal to dodge enemy attacks and not tank damage, as that allows enemies to quickly charge their Supers.
                            Bull's Super allows him to charge a very long distance in any direction, destroying all obstacles in his way. Since Bull can deal maximum damage when he’s close to his target, this ability can be used for getting Bull close enough to enemies to defeat them. Make sure to aim you Super correctly and predict the enemy’s movement, so you can reach the enemy properly to defeat them, or use his Stomper Gadget to get as close as possible to the enemy. Bull’s Super can also come in handy when Bull needs to escape from enemies if in danger because of his Super’s long charging distance, which is useful in Bounty when overwhelmed by enemies. However, he’s not impervious to damage while charging, so be wary of nearby enemies. Also, be careful in Showdown when escaping as his Super’s long distance may force you into the poison clouds, however, this can be circumvented with his Stomper Gadget to interrupt his charge.
                            Bull is very useful in Heist, as he can rush over water and break the obstacles in front of the enemy safe. The opening that he creates by his Super can also be utilized by teammates to attack the safe. He’s also viable in the mode with his heavy damage at point-blank range, which can be utilized to destroy the safe easily.
                            Bull is also effective in Brawl Ball with his high health and Super that destroys obstacles, because he can easily clear openings in the map, assisting his teammates in scoring. He can also self-pass, by kicking the Ball forward and charging towards it, then attempting to score. However, avoid using your Super to make enemies lose the ball by knocking them back, as he can break your team’s goalpost and other vital walls, as this only assists the enemies and allows them freely retrieve the ball and score. Instead, burst your attacks on them at close-range to quickly defeat them with your high damage.
                            Bull's Berserker Star Power doubles his reload speed, allowing Bull to have the highest overall damage output of any Brawler. Bull can use this power to dominate the robots in Boss Fight and Robo Rumble. Bull is also an ideal Power Cube Carrier in Boss Fight and a solid Brawler in Takedown, as you can use the Power Cubes and Bull’s high burst damage to engage the Big Boss, while surviving longer with his T-Bone Injector Gadget and his Tough Guy Star Power and his high health, or to defeat the Boss quicker with his Berserker Star Power and Stomper Gadget, respectively. You can also use this in Heist if you happen to be fairly low on health whilst approaching the safe to incinerate the enemy safe. While he is the Boss in Big Game, you can also use this as an extra boost to his damage output, though being the Boss already boosts your reload speed tremendously.
                            Bull fares well with throwers who are great at area control such as Barley or Tick, especially in Duo Showdown. They could lure and annoy enemies by placing their mines/bottles everywhere, respectively, and Bull, being a Brawler with high health and damage, can quickly finish those enemies off.
                            Bull’s T-Bone Injector Gadget is extremely useful to heal up when in danger, especially if you don’t have your Super to escape or don’t have healers on your team, and it can also allow you to tank damage effectively.
                            Use Bull’s Stomper Gadget to catch flanking enemies by surprise. Bull's high burst damage will allow him to get shots before a enemy can react. In some cases, Stomper can also cancel Supers that will inadvertently lead you into danger or Supers that enemies have already countered. <br><br><br><br><br>

                Jessie is a Common Brawler who is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 500 Trophies. She has moderate health and damage. Her attack is an electric orb that bounces between enemies when it hits them. Her Super plants Scrappy, a turret with moderate health and damage that excels at attacking, distracting or defending. Her first Gadget, Spark Plug, creates a shockwave around Scrappy that slows down enemies. Her second Gadget, Recoil Spring, doubles Scrappy's attack speed for 5 seconds. Her first Star Power, Energize, allows her to heal her turret by attacking it and her second Star Power, Shocky, allows her turret to shoot mini energy orbs that can bounce between enemies.
                Attack: Shock Rifle
                "Jessie fires off an energy orb. After hitting a target the orb bounces to the next target in range, hitting up to three enemies. Each bounce deals 25% less damage."
                
                Jessie fires a medium-ranged, medium-width energy orb with moderate damage. When the orb hits an enemy, it bounces toward the next nearest enemy, even enemies who are outside its range, behind walls or inside bushes. It can bounce up to 2 times more after that and hit 3 enemies in total before disappearing. The projectile's damage is decreased by 25% after bouncing as well as its speed and range, but the bounces don’t affect its Super charge rate.

                Super: Scrappy!
                "Jessie deploys a gun turret that automatically shoots at enemies. It's made of 100% recycled materials!"
                
                For her Super, Jessie deploys a turret with the same health as Jessie herself. This turret can be thrown anywhere and over walls within a short distance from Jessie. The turret is stationary and fires medium-ranged shots at enemies. The shots themselves deal rather low damage but the firing speed gives it a decent damage potential.
                Gadgets
                Spark Plug
                "Jessie triggers a shockwave from her turret, slowing down all enemies within its area of effect."
                
                By using this Gadget, Jessie's turret triggers a shockwave around itself, slowing down enemies within its area of effect. The slow duration lasts for 4 seconds, and the shockwave has a radius of 4.33 tiles. The Gadget can only be used while Jessie has a turret from her Super active on the map within 12 tiles of her location.
                Recoil Spring
                "Scrappy's attack speed is doubled for 5.0 seconds."
                
                Upon activation, Jessie doubles her turret's attack speed for 5 seconds. These bullets retain their properties from her Shocky Star Power and can charge Jessie's Super when hitting enemies. If Jessie is defeated, the turret's reload speed is reverted back to normal. The Gadget can only be used while Jessie has a turret from her Super active on the map within 12 tiles of her location.
                Star Powers
                Energize
                "Jessie can repair her gun turret for 896 of its missing health by zapping it with her attack."
                
                Jessie's Star Power allows her to hit her turret with her main attack to heal it for 896 health. The attack still bounces towards the closest enemy like normal, even if the turret is still at full health. This affects Jessie's attack damage reduction for each bounce.
                Shocky
                "Scrappy the Turret now shoots energy orbs that bounce between enemies. The orbs' range after a bounce is 51% of normal range."
                
                This allows Jessie's turret to shoot energy orbs instead of the usual bullets that can hit multiple enemies by bouncing between them, similar to Jessie's attacks. The attack speed, range, and damage of the turret remain the same. The bullets' range and travel time is decreased after hitting an enemy. A maximum of 3 enemies can be hit from a single bullet.
                Tips
                
                    After hitting a target, Jessie's attack always bounces towards the nearest enemy that hasn't already been hit. This can be used to determine enemy positions, even if they are out of range or hiding in bushes, or invisible such as Leon or Sandy.
                    The bounce mechanic of Jessie's attack can quickly cripple entire teams. Lock down choke-points or linear sections of the map to punish grouped up enemies by dealing considerable damage to them and rapidly charging your Super.
                    Jessie's turret can deal considerable damage if ignored, making it an excellent way to distract enemies if they attempt to destroy it.
                    Jessie's turret deals small but noticeable damage that racks up quickly. Unfortunately, it can be easily avoided by running perpendicular along its attack direction. Prevent enemies from dodging effectively by placing the turret in a place where it can cover a linear area.
                    While in a bush, Jessie's turret is invisible to enemies unless they are also in the bush and right next to it. Enemies right next to it in a bush are so visible by Jessie and her teammates. However, just like a player, the turret will become visible while attacking or taking damage.
                    Due to the mechanism of their attacks, Mortis and Frank in particular struggle to destroy Jessie's turrets, and may take a lot of damage in the process. Mortis can’t hit the turret unless he is touching it, guaranteeing the turret hits on him, and what makes it worse is his incredibly slow reload speed and the rapid fire of the turret can do substantial damage while Frank pauses before he launches each attack. Accordingly, it can be useful to specifically target these Brawlers on the enemy team when placing the turret. Using Jessie‘s Star Power Energize, she can also heal the turret and hit the above mentioned Brawlers if they decide to attack the turret.
                    In Heist, Jessie's turret can be placed in front of their safe to help defend against enemies by shielding the safe and by dealing damage. Likewise, it can also be used offensively against the enemy safe with the help of her Recoil Spring Gadget to multiply the turrets damage output.
                        Her Energize Star Power helps keep the turret survive for longer and extend Jessie's range by bouncing her attacks. Meanwhile, her Shocky Star Power will allow Jessie's turret's attacks to bounce off and potentially hit more enemies, who could either be defenders on the enemy side or attackers on your safe.
                        Be wary of Penny when placing her turret to defend, as otherwise she may be able to use the turret to potentially triple damage onto the safe.
                    When using Jessie's Energize, place her turret near an important chokepoint on the map and keep shooting at the turret to heal it while enemies are near it. This will continuously heal her turret while it deals damage, and her regular attacks can also deal damage to the enemies too.
                    Jessie can charge her Super very quickly. 6 hits (or 2 perfect shots hitting 3 enemies by bouncing) is enough to charge her Super without any pre-existing charge.
                    Turret placement is one of the most important skills with Jessie. When facing short-ranged Brawlers, place it out in the open so that they are forced to take attacks from it as they attempt to destroy it. When facing long-ranged Brawlers, place it next to their walls, but on her team's side of the wall so they have to walk around the wall to attack it and take damage. When facing throwers, throw it over the wall that they are hiding behind to do some damage to them and force them to use their attacks on the turret.
                    Jessie's Spark Plug Gadget is incredibly useful for taking down enemies. It can hit enemies through walls in a radius around the turret. After enemies are slowed down, Jessie can attack the enemy easily, and the turret can hit all shots while the enemy is slowed.
                    Jessie's Recoil Spring Gadget although capable of providing a lot of value, only excels when taking out stationary targets. It should be coupled with her Shocky Star Power, forcing enemies to take damage as they attempt to defend.
                    Jessie is amazing in Big Game when she is the Big Brawler because she can use her Super to defend herself. Her damage increases, her shots bounce and her reload speed increases too, making her a very decent Big Brawler in this mode. <br><br><br><br><br>

                Brock is a Common Brawler who is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 1000 Trophies. He has a low amount of health but shoots rockets at a very long-range that explode, dealing moderately high damage in a short radius. His Super fires a barrage of rockets in a large area. His first Gadget, Rocket Laces, allows him to fire at his feet, damaging nearby enemies and launching Brock into the air. His second Gadget, Rocket Fuel, makes Brock's next attack a more devastating mega rocket. His first Star Power, Incendiary, allows his rockets to leave a patch of fire which deal damage over time in the area of effect. His second Star Power, Rocket No. Four, increases Brock's ammo capacity to 4.

                "Brock lets fly with a single Rockin' Rocket that really goes the distance."
                
                Brock's attack is a far-reaching missile that deals high damage in a 1-tile radius on impact. However, his attacks reload rather slowly and travel slowly as well.

                When Brock's Super is used, he launches a volley of 9 rockets spread out over a large area, dealing heavy damage to targets. These rockets can destroy obstacles in a 1-tile radius or be fired over them. The Super takes 2.05 seconds to complete. Brock can still move while Rocket Rain is in effect, and the rockets fired will continue to hit the targeted area, regardless of Brock's position. However, he cannot attack while using his Super.

                When used, Brock will create an explosion with a range of 2.67 tiles under his feet to jump in the direction he faces, allowing him to jump over walls or water. Any enemy in the explosion will be knocked back. The explosion cannot destroy walls or bushes. If required to cross over a larger amount of blocks or water, his jumping distance will be increased up to a limit. While in the air, Brock is completely immune to all damage besides status effects and damage applied over time.
                Rocket Fuel
                "Brock's next attack is a mega rocket that is bigger, faster, explodes with a larger radius, destroys walls and deals 50% extra damage."
                
                When Brock activates this Gadget, his next attack deals 1.5 times the damage, travels 15% faster, is 50% bigger, and destroys cover with double the explosion radius. A Gadget symbol will glow above Brock's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after this attack is shot.

                Brock's rockets upon detonation or contact with an enemy, leave a patch of fire that disappears after two seconds. These flames have a 1 tile radius and deal 520 damage a second and are capable of dealing 1040 damage. Incendiary does not affect Brock's Super.

                Brock gains an extra ammo bar, allowing him to have up to 4 attacks ready at once. However, Brock’s reload speed remains the same, so it takes 33% longer for him to fully reload after firing all four rockets.
                Tips
                
                    Try to predict where opponents are going to be. His rockets are fairly slow and narrow, and the enemy Brawlers will likely be moving.
                    Brock performs the best in maps that are open and don't have a lot of cover so that short-ranged Brawlers can't ambush him.
                    Always keep Brock behind other teammates. Brock has fairly low health and is best used for long-ranged support.
                    In Duo Showdown, two Brawlers will most likely be near each other. Brock's rockets have a small area of explosion when it hits something or when the rocket‘s distance has been met. Shooting a rocket in between the two Brawlers when they're near will damage both of them greatly.
                    Because of Brock's painfully slow reload time, it's important to make every shot count. Don't fire off all three rockets at once, since that will leave Brock completely defenseless. While his Rocket No. Four Star Power can help alleviate this ammo deficit, it is still worthwhile to maintain your ammo for when you need it.
                    Use Brock's Super whenever the opponents group up or one is hiding behind a wall.
                    Brock's Super is great for getting the enemy team to split up as they avoid the rockets so that teammates can deal with them one-by-one.
                    Brock's Gadget, Rocket Laces, can be used for getting out of situations such as being charged by tanks. He can also use it to keep distance by jumping over walls or to get close to throwers behind walls.
                    At close-range, Brock can easily defeat lower-health Brawlers by quick-firing 3 rockets. Saving Brock's ammunition is especially useful for close-range ambushes.
                    Brock is not a good Brawler to use in level-based Special Events because he has slow reload speed and his Super can break walls, giving the robots a huge advantage in Robo Rumble and Boss Fight, and helping the Mega Monster destroy the city in Super City Rampage.
                    Use him in Heist to break the walls covering the enemy safe so that he can land burst damage on the enemy safe easily. Also, with his very long range, he can deal massive damage to the safe while staying relatively safe himself. His attack's slow movement speed will not be a disadvantage as the safe is stationary. His Star power, Incendiary, can help him deal tons of damage to the enemy safe.
                    Brock's Incendiary allows him to create a tiny area of flames which disappears after about 2 seconds. It deals 520 damage per second and can damage a Brawler twice, which means its maximum damage would be 1040, adding a significant damage boost if a Brawler stays in the area of effect. This can be used as a form of crowd control or to discourage Brawlers from leaving/entering a certain chokepoint.
                    Brock's Super can be used against a wall in front of a goal in Brawl Ball, meaning Brock does not have to go around the wall. This applies to all Brawl Ball maps with a wall in front of the goal.
                    Rocket Fuel's biggest impact is the splash damage it provides. Brock can deal splash damage, but it is rather difficult unless enemies stay within one tile. Making each individual shot count is vital for Brock whose reload speed makes him vulnerable once a couple of shots are fired. It also allows Brock to open up walls on the map without having to charge his Super first.
                    Brock can use Rocket Fuel to break open important walls on the map without needing to charge his Super - a very important tool in maps such as Backyard Bowl or Shooting Star. He can use his Gadget at the start of the match to give his team a huge defensive advantage. The attack's large splash damage can also be used to damage anyone hiding behind walls, preventing enemies from healing up and potentially defeating them. An additional advantage over his Super is that you can better predict the amount of walls Brock's Gadget will destroy as opposed to his Super, which only shows the area-of effect of possible missile hits which is harder to control. However, unlike his super, this shot can be body-blocked by enemies or spawnables (such as Scrappy or the shadows from Tara's Support from Beyond), as the attack does not pierce. <br><br><br><br><br>

                Dynamike is a Common Brawler who is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 2000 Trophies. He has low health but a high damage output. He attacks by lobbing sticks of dynamite over walls that blow up and deal high damage in a medium radius. For his Super, he throws a large barrel of dynamite that deals very high damage and knocks back surviving enemies in a large radius, while also destroying cover. His first Gadget, Fidget Spinner, allows him to rapidly fire sticks of dynamite in a radius around himself, along with a movement speed boost. His second Gadget, Satchel Charge, makes Dynamike's next main attack briefly stun enemies. His first Star Power, Dyna-Jump, allows his attack and Super to propel him over walls and Brawlers. His second Star Power, Demolition, allows his Super to deal more damage.
Attack: Short Fuse
"Mike tosses two sticks of dynamite, passing over any obstacles in the way. The fuses are cut as short as Mike's explosive temper!"

Dynamike throws two sticks of dynamite over walls that blow up after 1.1 seconds, dealing damage to any enemies caught in their 1.67 tile blast radii. The two sticks spread out a short distance from each other perpendicular to the direction of the throw as they travel, and they detonate simultaneously. If both sticks' explosions hit the enemy, the attack deals a high amount of damage.
Super: Big Barrel o' Boom
"A big-bada-barrel of dynamite blows up cover. Any surviving enemies get knocked back on impact!"

Dynamike throws the barrel bomb he carries on his back. The bomb can be thrown a fair distance, and after 1.3 seconds, it detonates and deals very high damage to enemies within its 2.67 blast radius. Any enemy survivors are knocked back from the explosion. The explosion also destroys obstacles.
Gadgets
Fidget Spinner
"Dynamike spins furiously with increased movement speed and throws multiple sticks of dynamite around himself. Each dynamite deals 1200 damage to enemies."

Dynamike rapidly fires a total of 20 sticks of dynamite within a 9 tile radius around him, each stick dealing 1200 damage upon detonation. He receives a 19% speed boost for the 2 second duration, but is unable to attack while this Gadget is in effect. His Dyna-Jump Star Power doesn’t affect this Gadget.
Satchel Charge
"Once activated, the next main attack also stuns enemies for 1.5 seconds."

Dynamike's next attack stuns enemies hit by its explosion for 1.5 seconds. A Gadget symbol will glow above Dynamike's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after this attack is shot.
Star Powers
Dyna-Jump
"Dynamike can ride the blast wave of his explosives to jump over obstacles!"

Dynamike's main attack and Super can propel him into the air to jump a short distance opposite and away from the detonation point. He can use this to jump over walls and Brawlers. His Super propels him further than his attack when detonated. While in the air, Dynamike is completely immune to all damage besides status effects and damage applied over time.
Demolition
"Adds +1000 damage to Mike's Super."

Dynamike's Super deals 1000 more damage. This doesn’t affect other aspects of his Super.
Tips

    Dynamike's dynamites can deal massive damage if thrown correctly. Since the dynamite has a delay before blowing up, try predicting the enemy’s movement and throwing it where the enemy is likely to be by the time the dynamite detonates. Auto-aiming almost guarantees a miss against moving enemies.
    Hiding behind a bush with a wall in front of it and throwing the dynamite towards the enemy from there can be effective since it’s difficult for most other Brawlers to reach you, and they’ll be caught by surprise due to you being hidden.
    When being chased by a close-ranged enemy, try throwing your dynamites a bit in front of you. This either makes your enemy stop chasing you or take damage from your attack. If they are somewhere between 3 and 5 tiles away, try throwing about a tile in front of their current position with similar results.
    Try throwing your Super to damage at least two enemies, because as it deals enough damage to charge another the Super, allowing you to throw it again.
    In Showdown, if your enemy is near the gas, you can throw your Big Barrel o' Boom to push them into the gas for them to take extra damage. The Super already deals massive damage, and when with coupled with the gas, it can secure a defeat against low-medium health enemies. Your Demolition Star Power also helps for this.
    In Gem Grab or Siege, throwing an attack near a Gem/Bolt can drive enemies away from it, therefore allowing Dynamike or his teammates to get the item more easily and preventing enemies from retrieving it.
    Dynamike's damage radius decreases as he throws the sticks closer to himself, making it significantly harder to hit enemies close to him. However, he can also use this to his advantage as such enemies are more likely to be hit by both dynamites and will take more damage.
    Mortis and Edgar are huge counters to Dynamike due to their above-average speed and dashing and jumping capabilities, which help him escape Dynamike's delayed shots, so watch out for them before they can burst you down. Alternatively, if caught by them, you can use Satchel Charge to possibly change the fate of the fight, but make sure you land the shot correctly on them or make Mortis waste his ammo so you can throw the shot easily. You can also use your Fidget Spinner Gadget's speed boost to escape before they get too close to you, but it isn't very useful when they’ve already reached you because of Mortis's dash, Edgar’s jump, and their above-average speed.
    A difficult but rewarding tactic with Dynamike is where you aim Dynamike's Super and quickly toss a main attack in such a way that you can get the Super to push enemies into the sticks of dynamite. This deals extreme amounts of damage to them and usually eliminates them unless they’re heavyweights like Bull, Rosa, Frank, or El Primo. If the enemy had enough health and the sticks of dynamite were perfectly placed, Dynamike also instantly recharges his Super.
    His Dyna-Jump Star Power is effective to escape from nasty situations by throwing dynamite at your feet. This not only damages nearby enemies but also throw you back some distance, avoid damage, and allow for a speedy escape over walls. In desperate situations, his Super propels him even further, making it a more reliable tool for escape while also being able to damage and even defeat enemies due to the large amounts of damage dealt by the Super or attack.
    Though the timing is tricky, it’s possible to jump over enemy attacks with Dynamike's Dyna-Jump Star Power. This is rare, but can help in sticky situations when under heavy fire.
    His Fidget Spinner Gadget is useful for checking bushes because it covers an extremely wide area. He can also use his Gadget to reliably defeat low-health enemies who are very close to him, which would be otherwise very hard to hit with his main attack.
    Dynamike's attack fuse makes it hard for him to defend. Satchel Charge allows him to burst enemies down safely, especially low-health ones. This is also incredibly useful in Heist when attempting to take out heavyweights. His reliance on this Gadget makes it more niche in offense-oriented modes such as Bounty, where stuns are valuable tools to have.
    Dynamike's Satchel Charge Gadget and Demolition Star Power is a good build for Dynamike. In certain situations, Dynamike can stun enemies and then throw his Super at them. Due to the stun, the enemy won't be able to dodge the Super as people often do nor can they provide counter fire. Demolition deals a lot of damage to the enemy and, coupled with the attack, it’ll incinerate out medium-to lower-health Brawlers. For tanks, throw more attacks with the Super to knock them out while they're stunned. Though not necessary, Demolition, if available, should definitely be used because it aids in taking out or heavily damaging Brawlers, especially tanks. <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/e/ee/Bo_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20190416001137" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Bo is a Common Brawler unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 3000 Trophies. He has moderate health, a moderately high damage output, and immense utility with his Super. He attacks by firing three long-ranged arrows that explode in a small radius at the end of their range. His Super places three traps that can be triggered to explode a moment later by being walked on by an enemy, damaging and knocking enemies back upon exploding. His first Gadget, Super Totem, places a totem that slowly charges the Supers of Bo and his allies while inside its area of effect. His second Gadget, Tripwire, manually detonates his traps. His first Star Power, Circling Eagle, increases his field of view into bushes. His second Star Power, Snare a Bear, causes his traps to stun enemies momentarily instead of knocking them back.
Attack: Eagle-eyed
"Bo releases a trio of exploding arrows, tearing up enemies like an eagle's talons."

Bo shoots three explosive arrows at a long range that can deal moderately high damage to enemies within a small radius of the explosion. They are fired with a small sweeping spread from left to right. The attack takes 0.85 seconds to complete.
Super: Catch a Fox
"Bo hides explosive traps in the ground. When triggered by an enemy, the traps explode after a short delay, knocking back and damaging enemies."

Bo lobs an arrow over obstacles that lays three mines on the ground upon landing. The mines are momentarily shown, before becoming invisible to enemies until they are triggered, and the traps are still visible to teammates. They trigger when enemies travel on their radius and explode 1.15 seconds later, dealing damage, destroying nearby obstacles, and knocking back any enemies inside its 2 tile blast radius. When triggered, they will beep and flash before exploding.
Gadgets
Super Totem
"Bo drops a totem that recharges his and any allies' Supers within the area of effect. The totem slowly loses its health over time."

Bo drops a small totem pole that will recharge his and any allies' Supers 5% per second within the area of affect. A total of 20 seconds is needed to recharge a full Super with this Gadget. The totem has 1000 health and a radius of 2.67 tiles. The previous totem is immediately destroyed if Bo places another totem. The charging effect will stack with other passive Super charging abilities like another Bo's totem and the passive Super charging abilities of Darryl and Edgar, such as Edgar’s Let’s Fly Gadget. The totem will be destroyed after 20 seconds.
Tripwire
"Bo triggers all of his mines after 1.5 seconds. During the delay the mines are completely undetected to opponents."

Bo's traps will automatically explode 1.5 seconds after this Gadget's activation. This detonation has the same effect as when triggered by enemies, and activates Bo's Snare a Bear Star Power; however, enemies can’t see the mines before detonation.
Star Powers
Circling Eagle
"Bo spots enemies hidden in bushes from 150% longer distance than normally."

This Star Power allows Bo and his team to see 5 tiles into bushes, instead of 2 tiles Brawlers normally get. This allows Bo and his allies to detect enemies in bushes before they can see him/them.
Snare a Bear
"Instead of a knockback, Bo's traps now stun the enemy for 2.0 seconds!"

Bo's traps now stun enemies for 2 seconds instead of knocking them back, rendering them vulnerable. The stun does not stack; instead, it starts over when another mine hits an enemy.
Tips

    Bo's Super can be used to defend critical areas and choke points on the battlefield. Enemies heading in the area will take high damage when they step on the traps. It can be utilized to cover the Gem mine in Gem Grab to damage enemy Brawlers who are gathering Gems from it. It can also be used to cover key choke points in Showdown, zone(s) in Hot Zone and Bolt spawning areas in Siege, making Bo an ideal control Brawler.
    Bo’s fairly high health can be used to walk the Ball into the enemy goal in Brawl Ball. In addition, Bo’s traps can be used to destroy enemy cover and goalposts. Clearing up certain maps could be beneficial due to Bo’s relatively long range, especially if he has teammates with long-ranged abilities. Hence, Bo is a viable Brawler in Brawl Ball.
    Bo always shoots three arrows from left to right, so you can take advantage of this to control the spread of your arrows. If you want to concentrate fire in a small area, move left while firing, allowing more arrows to hit a single target. For an attack with more spread, move right. The space between each arrow will be increased, giving the attack a wider spread. However, the former strategy only works on stationary targets as Brawlers will most likely be moving and can thus dodge all three arrows.
    Bo's Circling Eagle is really useful on maps filled with bushes, with his doubled radius of vision in bushes. Some maps include Cavern Churn, Feast or Famine, NruhC nrevaC, Island Invasion, and Snake Prairie. Since you have a sight advantage, avoid getting close to tanks or other high-damaging Brawlers. Place his traps to cover the lane with only one passageway while you can cover the other side with your increased sight. When played properly, Bo can quite easily dominate bushy maps. This is really useful in 3v3, for his increased sight in bushes is shared with teammates too.
    Bo's traps can knockback enemies, so if placed correctly, it can knock enemies into the poison gas in Showdown. With Bo's Snare a Bear, Bo's traps will instead stun, giving you ample time to quickly defeat opponents without any risk of dying, making this effective in Knockout, Lone Star, and Bounty. In Duo Showdown, Bo can be used with a high-damaging Brawler, such as Darryl or Shelly to finish off a stunned enemy.
    Bo's traps can be lobbed over walls. This is great when you know there’s a Brawler hiding in a bush opposite to you behind a wall. Throw it ahead of them, so they’re forced to walk into it, as they cannot go through the wall unless their airborne or have a destructive Super charged up. With the Tripwire Gadget, you can deal immediate damage to them.
    Bo's Super Totem Gadget can be used near your team's spawn points to allow them to gain their Super before a team match. This also decreases the chance of the enemy team destroying your totem.
    Bo's Snare a Bear Star Power can come into great effect in several Special Events. If one is stunned, you and your teammates can deal massive damage to them temporarily without being targeted. This includes the Bosses in Super City Rampage, Robo Rumble and Boss Fight.
    When an enemy tries to disarm your traps, use Bo's Tripwire Gadget to catch them off guard and deal instant damage. Coupled with Bo's second Star Power, Bo can passively force enemies to not disarm his mines. This allows him to control open areas simply by selecting this Gadget.
    When Bo's Super is used, the third trap is set slightly after the other two. Thus, activating Bo's Tripwire Gadget immediately after using his Super only explodes two traps. In Brawl Ball, this can be used to explode walls or obstacles in front of the enemies' goal effectively, which makes it much easier to score. This also leaves one trap hidden until an enemy steps on it, so you can use the last trap for other strategies such as bait for the Ball.
    Try to use Bo's Tripwire Gadget before the enemy steps onto it, since the 1.5 second delay allows the enemy to escape. Also, note that the 1.5 second delay takes longer than its normal 1.15 seconds.
    If Bo manages to place his mines on the IKE turret in Siege or on the Heist safe, he can activate Tripwire as soon as he can to deal immediate high damage to the safe/IKE turret.
    Only use Super Totem in rather passive events like Bounty and Showdown where you can get the objective by simply by camping (in this case, near the totem to charge your Supers). Use Tripwire in other events that require you to achieve an active objective like Gem Grab and Siege because you can’t afford to stay near the totem for a long time when you should be working towards the objective of the game (in which, in the above examples, is collecting Gems and Siege Bolts), and you should make use of the control abilities Tripwire offers. <br><br><br><br><br>

Tick is a Common Brawler who is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 4000 Trophies. He has the lowest health of any Brawler but a high damage potential. He attacks by lobbing three mines over obstacles that detonate when a target is near them or after a delay. His Super launches his head, which chases after the nearest enemy and upon reaching its enemy, it deals high area damage and destroys obstacles on impact. His first Gadget, Mine Mania, doubles the amount of mines for his next attack. His second Gadget, Last Hurrah, grants him a temporary shield before an explosion that knocks enemies back. His first Star Power, Well Oiled, allows him to self-heal faster than normal. His second Star Power, Automa-Tick Reload, increases his attack’s reload speed.

Attack: Minimines
"Tick lobs a cluster of mines that separate before landing. The mines explode on contact with a target, or after a few seconds."

When Tick attacks, he throws a projectile over walls, splitting into three mines that spread over a large area. If a target is in close proximity to a mine, it explodes, dealing damage. Otherwise, the mines explode after a 2-second delay. The mines have a delay in the air, and his reload speed is very slow, but the damage of all mines combined is immense. The spread of the mines increases the further away they are thrown.
Super: Headfirst
"Tick detaches and launches his head. After landing, the head hops toward the nearest target and explodes on contact!"

When Tick uses his Super, he detaches his head and launches it over obstacles. After landing, the head chases the nearest enemy like a homing missile. Upon reaching an enemy, it explodes, dealing very high area damage and knocking the enemy back while also destroying nearby obstacles. However, the head has health like any spawnable, and if it’s destroyed before it reaches a target, it explodes and still destroys obstacles but only deals damage if an enemy was in its explosion radius. His head can still locate and chase enemies in bushes, but can’t detect invisible enemies (i.e. Sandy etc.).
Gadgets
Mine Mania
"Tick's next attack fires 6 mines."

Upon activation, Tick's next main attack fires 6 mines instead of 3, which deals double the usual damage in total. Like his original attack, these mines spread out more or less depending on the distance travelled. A Gadget symbol will glow above Tick's head signaling the Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing joystick. The Gadget's cooldown starts after using this attack.
Last Hurrah
"Tick gains a 50% shield for 1.0 seconds. After that, it bursts out for 1000 damage."

Tick gains a 50% shield for 1 second and then explodes, dealing 1000 damage to enemies and knocking them back in a radius around him. This Gadget doesn’t hinder movement.
Star Powers
Well Oiled
"When Tick takes no damage and doesn't attack, he starts recovering health 2.0 seconds faster than normal."

Tick now self-regenerates 1 second after being damaged or attacking, instead of the usual 3 seconds.
Automa-Tick Reload
"Tick's reload time is 9% shorter."

Tick reloads his attack 0.2 seconds faster than normal.
Tips

    Tick has the lowest health of any Brawler and a very slow reload speed, but his long range, high damage output, and his ability to attack over obstacles compensates for it. Hence, you should generally avoid going near fights and support your teammates by taking cover and attacking from behind walls. Tick thrives in maps with an abundance of walls such as Some Assembly Required or Cavern Churn, because he can use the walls to his advantage by staying behind them while supporting his other teammates, or in Solo Showdown, himself.
    Tick is very effective as a control Brawler, especially with his Mine Mania Gadget. Predict where the enemy will head and throw your mines there instead of directly throwing your mines at them. This forces them back, because if they step on all 3 of his mines, they’ll take a huge amount of damage. Tick can prevent enemies from collecting vital items or heading into vital areas such as Gems in Gem Grab, Bolts in Siege, the blue Star in Bounty, Power Cubes in Showdown, zones in Hot Zone, or the Ball/trophy in Brawl Ball/Trophy Thieves/Hold the Trophy by throwing mines at the above items, and enemies will take damage if they attempt to retrieve the items, and therefore, they’ll avoid such areas. Note that Tick's attacks also spread out the further away he throws them. This means that on defense, he can hit all three mines, but on offense, he may have a harder time hitting all three of his mines. Make sure to throw his attacks in different places to avoid enemies dodging every single mine.
    Tick's mines, when thrown directly towards the border of the map, they’ll hit the edge of the map and clump up at the edge unlike its usual triangular formation. Leading an enemy near the border of the map and throwing mines at the wall means the enemy can take a lot of damage from the clumped mines near the wall.
    Tick's head can inflict area damage that can also destroy obstacles and is capable of chasing Brawlers into closed areas. His head can be destroyed easily, so use it against low-health enemies to force them to attack and halt self-healing, an enemy who has used up all ammo, or a Brawler very close to him. He can also use his Super in Brawl Ball on enemy defenders near their goal, because if the head hits the enemies, it can defeat a large number of them with its area damage as well as break the goalpost and other goal obstacles to help teammates score at ease.
    Tick is vulnerable to large bush areas that can be found in matches like Snake Prairie and Cavern Churn. Heavyweights and assassins could pop out of the bushes and eliminate Tick easily when he is close. However, Tick also has an advantage in bush areas. His Super can be used in bushes and his head would detect the closest enemy and damage it while the head is unnoticeable. He can also throw his mines at narrow lanes so that enemies take damage, which reveals and hinders them if they attempt to sneak up on you/your team.
    Since Tick has the lowest health of any Brawler, he’s more effective in Duo Showdown rather than Solo Showdown. He can lure or annoy the enemies by placing mines all around them, and then the other teammate (preferably someone with more health and/or damage, such as Bull) can finish that enemy off. In Solo Showdown, Tick struggles in close-combat as heavyweights and assassins are often used in this event, so if playing Tick in Solo Showdown, hide behind obstacles and control areas while also damaging enemies if they walk into the mines, and use his Last Hurrah Gadget if you’re stuck in close-quarters combat.
    Frank or Tara are very effective when paired with Tick because their Supers stun/pull multiple enemy Brawlers, respectively, allowing Tick to hit them with his attacks more easily and his Super.
    In Showdown, if possible, it’s an effective strategy to use Tick to trap enemies in the poison gas. Keep deploying mines at exit points until they die to the poison gas. If they manage to escape, he can finish them off with his Super.
    Try not to hit enemies by auto-aiming all ammo at once, especially towards father targets. This is because Tick's attacks spread out, which result in the mines not hitting. Try aiming to hit at least one mine and use his attacks wisely to force enemies to move to certain positions, or create opportunities to progress by spreading his mines over a large area. Tick can’t afford to waste ammo because his reload speed is painfully slow.
    If Tick is being chased or is pressured by close-ranged Brawlers, try to leave a trail of mines behind him to deter enemies. Auto-aiming is dubious because unlike most throwers, Tick's mines spread out regardless of where he threw them. So, when being chased, manually aim the mines slightly in front of them in tandem with his Super or Last Hurrah Gadget to push the enemy back into the mines, hopefully keeping them away or even defeating them. You can also save your Super or Last Hurrah Gadget to defend against close-ranged Brawlers to knock them back and allow you to escape. If you don’t have or can use either of these tactics, hide behind obstacles and keep your distance from enemies. These strategies should be especially used against Edgar and Mortis, who counter throwers easily.
    When defending yourself in close-combat with your Super or Last Hurrah Gadget, you must use these wisely. For his Last Hurrah Gadget, you should position yourself when using it so they aren’t knocked into a wall, because if they do, they can re-approach you. If you’re can’t position yourself because you’re in walled maps, throw your mines at your feet to further prevent a re-approach. For Tick's Super, throw your Super in front of you rather than throwing it behind you. This is because if the Super is thrown behind the pursuing enemy, it could make matters worse by knocking the enemy into you, whereas, throwing the Super in front of you knocks the enemy away from you, therefore allowing you to escape.
    In Team Events, an allied Gale, Bibi, or Gene can push, knock, pull enemies into Tick's mines, dealing massive damage. If you see them with their disruptive effect charged up, you'll want to throw your mines in the direction the victim will head.
    When an enemy is using a teleporter or launchpad, Tick can launch his mines to the location where the enemy ends up, guaranteeing massive damage if not defeating them once they land or teleport.
    Tick is mediocre in Heist due to his poor survivability and very slow reload speed. Therefore, if you're playing Tick in Heist, try to hide behind use obstacles and damage the safe from there, as the enemies won’t be able to hit you easily, and on defense, again, hide behind obstacles and block off any areas or choke points that inadvertently allow enemies to damage the safe. If possible, use his Mine Mania Gadget and Automa-Tick Reload Star Power to amplify your damage potential on the safe, though these two abilities are rather required to properly use Tick in Heist. <br><br><br><br><br>

"Deploys a turret that increases the damage output of all friendly Brawlers in its area of effect."

8-BIT deploys a turret that increases the damage output of himself and allies inside its radius by 35%. This also increases the healing power of Brawlers with attacks or Supers that heal (such as Poco or Byron), but doesn’t affect spawnables or other entities (such as Nita's bear, Jessie's turret, the Siege Bot, the IKE Turret, etc.) and doesn’t stack with other 8-BIT’s Supers, nor does it affect Gadgets or Star Powers such. If a Brawler's abilities make them move out of the radius, such as Bull's and El Primo's Supers, and they were previously inside the Booster, then the damage boost is applied. For an allied Colette, Damage Booster buffs are applied after her base damage is calculated.
Gadgets
Cheat Cartridge
"8-BIT instantly teleports to his Damage Booster."

8-BIT instantly teleports to the location of his booster. He has to be within 12 tiles of his booster to be able to use this Gadget. He retains any status effects while teleporting.
Extra Credits
"8-BIT's next attack has the number of projectiles increased to 18."

After activation, 8-BIT's next attack shoots 18 lasers instead of 6, dealing 3 times the damage of his normal attack in a single attack if all of the lasers hit. Since his attack fires triple the amount of projectiles, the attack takes thrice as long to complete. A Gadget symbol will glow above 8-BIT's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after this attack is shot.
Star Powers
Boosted Booster
"Increases the Damage Booster's range by 50% and boosts damage by an additional 15%."

This increases the radius of the Damage Booster to from 3.33 tiles to 5 tiles, allowing it to cover more ground, as well as boosting the damage boost from 35% to 50%.
Plugged In
"When 8-BIT is near his Damage Booster, he will plug in and have increased movement speed."

When 8-BIT is within 7 tiles of his Damage Booster, his movement speed is increased from 580 points to 720 points. The area of effect from this Star Power covers the damage boost area of effect, so staying inside his Damage Booster’s range boosts both his speed and damage output. This Star Power has a delay before taking effect.
Tips

    The most important thing to do when playing as 8-BIT is to charge and activate his Super. His Super can control a large area and can easily allow you and allies to deal large amounts of damage to enemies. If your Super is taken down, focus on charging up a second Super and pushing back enemies.
    Other than his very slow movement speed, 8-BIT has all that one would require from a Brawler - high health and a high damage output, long range, a reasonable reload speed, area control, and even some support abilities, so he functions well in most game modes. However, he is most viable in Heist, Gem Grab, Hot Zone, and Siege due to his high damage output and area control capabilities. In Bounty, Showdown, Knockout, Special Events, and speed-based events such as Brawl Ball, his slow movement speed hinders his survivability, but his high health, long range, and high damage output compensates for that, making him still viable in these modes.
    8-BIT’s is very vulnerable to fast Brawlers such as Crow and Leon. At the start of Showdown matches, focus first in defeating these Brawlers at a distance before they get closer and can deal higher damage. 8-BIT has one of the longest ranges in the game to compensate for his slow movement, so keep your distance from enemy Brawlers and out-range them, and if an enemy is chasing you, deal as much damage as you can to them from a distance to force enemy retreat. Additionally, you can also escape by using your Cheat Cartridge Gadget to teleport back to your booster and far away from enemies. However, be cautious of airborne Brawlers like El Primo and Edgar who are also fast and can close the distance with their jumps and easily defeat 8-BIT at close range.
    If you are low on health and someone is chasing you, you can place your booster down to tank some shots so you can escape more easily. Keep in mind, this won’t be effective against Penny, Jessie, Surge, Belle, or any other Brawler with mechanics that can deal damage to multiple enemies, as their projectiles won’t be fully blocked. Also, note that this should be a last-resort action, as he depends on his booster quite a lot.
    Due to 8-BIT's slow movement speed, dodging projectiles from other sharpshooters like Colt or throwers like Barley is difficult. So dealing damage behind cover or from afar is recommended as the enemies won’t be able to hit him as easily. This can be compensated with his Plugged In Star Power or other speed boosts, as 8-BIT can fight the fast and long-ranged Brawlers with ease that he’s usually prone to in Showdown. It can also be very useful to control, retreat, and reach a target in most 3v3 modes and special events. Though, Boosted Booster is preferred in Robo Rumble, Boss Fight, and Super City Rampage, where speed is less beneficial.
    8-BIT's Cheat Cartridge Gadget can be used to rush and surprise an enemy by throwing his booster over the wall towards the enemy before teleporting to attack them with increased damage, since he normally can’t rush an enemy due to his very slow movement speed. It can also be used to escape enemies by teleporting away if you're low on health or if you’re being cornered.
    8-BIT's Extra Credits Gadget combined with his Super would deal enough damage to eliminate almost all Brawlers in-game without losing ammo, but it can be easily avoided. Use it on modes with stationary targets like Heist and Siege, with it dealing devastating damage to these above examples. You may also use it in Special Events to deal extra damage to the Bosses in each event, but note that mobility is very important in Super City Rampage and might justify the usage of Cheat Cartridge.
    Byron can use his healing abilities to further justify 8-BIT's already high health at a range, and 8-BIT's Super can boost Byron's healing, so they have a great synergy together, especially in Duo Showdown. This can also lead to devastating results in Siege if 8-BIT and Byron can remain concealed up to the corners closest to the enemy IKE. 8-BIT must place his booster down to boost his damage and Byron’s healing, and Byron heals 8-BIT while 8-BIT deals damage to the IKE, especially with his Extra Credits Gadget. High-damaging Brawlers like Amber, Spike, and Colt also work well with 8-BIT and help him get the most out of the booster.
    It is typically a good idea to place your booster behind a wall (unless attacking where you can tank damage with the booster) because it’ll be harder to destroy and if someone gets there, you can use Cheat Cartridge to eliminate them. This is even more effective with Boosted Booster as it can provide more area of damage boost when keeping the booster behind a wall makes it hard to stay near it. However, this strategy is countered by throwers, Sprout, and Squeak as they can hit the booster regardless of any walls in their way.
    When on low health and hiding in a bush, try not to place your Super when the Plugged In Star Power is equipped as the speed boost effect indicator coming from the Super can give away your location. However, if your plan is to escape rather than hide, you may place your Super to tank shots and speed you up.
    In Super City Rampage, 8-BIT's damage booster can be used as a last-resort meatshield to escape from the monster during the anger stages as the monster will attack any turrets and spawnables such as Jessie's turret and Nita's Bear. Unless the monster is distracted, 8-BIT can’t escape because of his very slow movement speed.
    An effective trap you can use, especially in Showdown, is to place your booster so that one side is behind a wall and a bush and the other is out in the open. When an enemy Brawler comes to destroy your booster, you can use your Cheat Cartridge Gadget to rush in and quickly eliminate the enemy, and if the enemy manages to destroy it, the damage dealt would’ve charged your Super back again, so you can pull off the trap again. If it’s a Brawler with moving abilities (Edgar, El Primo, Crow, etc.), use your long range to your advantage and aim your attack onto them if they do escape with their ability. This ensures them on low health or even defeats them. <br><br><br><br><br>

Emz is a Common Brawler who is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 8000 Trophies. She has moderate health but a high damage potential. Her attack is a shot of widespread hair spray that deals more damage if the enemy is in the middle of the attack. Her Super creates a temporary toxic effect in a large radius around her that slows down and deals damage over time to enemies in it. Her Gadget, Friendzoner, pushes away all nearby enemies in a radius around her while damaging them. Her first Star Power, Bad Karma, makes each tick from her attack additively increase in damage. Emz's second Star Power, Hype, slightly heals her every second her Super damages an enemy.
Attack: Spray
"Emz gives you a blast of her hair spray! It's strong enough to melt your face."

Emz sprays her hairspray that can pierce multiple enemies at once, dealing damage depending on how far the enemies are away from her. Her hairspray lingers at the end of its range, dealing tick damage every half-second. Thus, the end of her attack cloud deals 2 ticks of damage, its middle deals 3 ticks and near Emz it deals 1 tick.

Super: Caustic Charisma
"Emz creates a cloud of toxicity around herself, slowing down the movement of enemies and damaging them."

Emz creates a circular cloud of toxicity around herself with a large radius, slowing down and dealing low damage per second to enemies inside the radius. Her Super can’t be interrupted by stuns, pulls, or knockbacks. This area-of-effect moves with Emz.
Gadget: Friendzoner
"Emz pushes back all enemies around her while also dealing 500 damage."

Emz creates a wave that pushes all enemies in a small radius of about 2.67 tiles away from her while also dealing 500 damage to them. This effect can go through walls.
Star Powers
Bad Karma
"Enemies that stay within the cloud of Emz's toxic hair spray suffer increasing damage, 25% per hit."

Enemies that Emz hits take 25% more damage for each tick than the previous tick of damage before the attack disappears.
Hype
"Emz recovers 420 health per second for each enemy inside her Super's area of effect."

Enemy Brawlers that her Super damages recovers Emz for 420 health per second for each enemy damaged, which is up to a total of 2100 health over 5 seconds per Brawler.
Tips

    Emz can perform guerrilla tactics that both consist of spraying hairspray and running for cover in quick succession because of her attack’s lingering. However, unlike her Super, her main attacks don’t go through walls and open space is required for these tactics to work.
    When using her Super, try to damage enemies behind walls so that you can damage them while they're unable to do so. This strategy, however, can circumvent when facing throwers such as Barley who can still attack you regardless of walls in the way.
    As another Brawler, if Emz is chasing you, don't run away from her. Instead, get close to her to defeat her because the more time you stay in her gas, the more damage you'll take, so if you are close to her you’ll take less damage. One good example is Mortis, if you know how to dash, you can easily approach Emz without taking too much damage and quickly take her down. Be warned that experienced players will save their Super and Friendzoner Gadget to counter this tactic, therefore more caution is needed when using other Brawlers to get close to Emz. If you’re using airborne Brawlers such as Edgar, however, you can easily approach Emz with your jump and take her out.
    Emz can deal better damage in mid-long range so don't approach close-ranged Brawlers where they would have an advantage over you. In Bibi's case, however, you can use her knockback against her, which is opportunistic provided that you survived Bibi's knockback attack, and then you can spam your lingering spray, which forces Bibi to retreat.
    When using Emz's Super, try to position so that the enemy is near the edge of your Super range. This way, when you attack, the enemy will be slowed and forced to suffer from all 3 ticks of your attack.
    Emz is very effective at mid-long range. Try to keep the enemy you are attacking at about 2/3 of the attack range, as this causes the enemy to take the full amount of 3 ticks of damage. However, if the enemy is in very close proximity to you, you’ll only be able to deal 1 tick of damage, and if the enemy is at the far range of your attack, it’ll only do two. This makes Emz very vulnerable to close-ranged Brawlers who get close enough to her, especially airborne Brawlers like Edgar, El Primo, and Crow, and this requires her to use her Super or Friendzoner Gadget to distance her from such Brawlers.
    Emz is a great control Brawler in Gem Grab, Brawl Ball and especially Hot Zone due to her lingering attack. Use Emz to push your enemies to the opposing side while consistently collect gems in Gem Grab, keep enemies slowed down when they’re carrying the Ball in Brawl Ball or cover an area of the zone for a long time in Hot Zone.
    Emz can be useful when chasing down low-health Brawlers since her lingering attack can stack up to massive amounts of damage and her Super can slow down Brawlers who are escaping. This attribute is beneficial during desperate situations in Bounty or Gem Grab.
    Emz's attack speed is fast enough for her to fire another hairspray cloud before her previous attack has fully dissipated. The damage from both attacks stack on top of each other, effectively doubling her damage per tick. However, she reloads slowly, so try not to waste shots in the excitement of dealing high burst damage.
    The slow from Emz's Super provides a useful defense from close-ranged Brawlers, especially ones heavily reliant on movement abilities such as Mortis.
    Perhaps the largest weakness Emz has is that she cannot deal sufficient damage if a Brawler is close to her. Her Friendzoner Gadget covers this weakness. If an enemy Brawler is in close quarters with you, you can use it to push them back.
    Despite its small range and radius, Emz's Gadget can be used to either knock the Ball out of a Brawler's grasp in Brawl Ball, cancel Frank's or Carl’s Super or, in Showdown, push enemies into the poison gas if positioned accurately.
    Emz can shoot an attack at an enemy close to her and then use her Friendzoner Gadget immediately after, to push the enemy into the lingering area of her attack. While it requires very precise timing, this can cause enemies to take one extra tick of damage, which is beneficial in killing enemies faster.
    Emz with her Hype Star Power should use her Super when she can hit multiple enemies, as if she does so, her healing multiplies and keeps her alive for even more time than she would normally be. This encourages you even more to tackle multiple enemies if they're close to each other, already given her attack's area damage and lingering mechanics. She can perform team-wipes easily as she can rapidly charge her Super and heal significantly, helping her succeed even when outnumbered.
    Emz is better in open maps with ample space, so you should play her in maps like Massive Attack or Skull Creek, where her Super can maintain area control and her attack has an advantage in the moderately spaced field.
    Try to avoid engaging Buzz, as he’s a major counter to Emz. His Super can stun Emz and pull him towards her, allowing Buzz to easily eliminate her, and despite his short range, his Trait enables him to charge his Super passively, which allows him to play passive around obstacles to charge his Super. If you’re facing Buzz, though this is risky, get close to Buzz immediately even if he doesn’t have his Super, and use your Friendzoner Gadget to push him back, allowing you to effectively attack him or escape from him, unless Buzz has his Super charged up.
    Similar to Gene using his Lamp Blowout Gadget to score in Brawl Ball, you can also try this strategy by scoring with your Friendzoner Gadget. Firstly, get directly close to the enemy goal’s side walls, which should have enemy defenders blocking the goal. If you have the Ball, immediately kick it towards the nearest enemy, because the enemy should be carrying it in order for this to work. Then, use your Friendzoner Gadget to push the enemy back, which knocks the Ball out of their grasp, and if you’re near the side wall, it’ll push the Ball into the goal unless an enemy is inside the goal to circumvent this strategy and block the Ball. <br><br><br><br><br>

Stu is a Common Brawler who is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 10000 Trophies. Stu has low health and moderate damage, but has a unique ability to charge his Super in one hit. He attacks with two fireworks, and his Super is a short-ranged dash that leaves a trail of fire behind him, burning enemies that touch it. His Gadget, Speed Zone, places a booster that increases the movement speed of himself and allies in a large area-of-effect around it. His first Star Power, Zero Drag, increases his Super's range. His second Star Power, Gaso-Heal, heals him slightly when he uses his Super.
Attack: Razzle Dazzle
"Stu fires out two pyrotechnic shots that pack quite a wallop."

Stu shoots two pyrotechnic fireworks linearly in quick succession that each charge one full Super. This attack has a fast unload speed, taking 0.35 seconds to complete.

"Hitting an opponent with Razzle Dazzle charges up Stu's Nitro Boost, a short dash that leaves a trail of burning rubber on the ground. The trail will set fire to any opponents that touch it."

Stu dashes forward a short distance, leaving a small trail of burning rubber on the ground that when enemies touch it, they’re set on fire and take four ticks of burn damage. The fire doesn’t stack in damage but touching it more than once resets the burn duration. Stu can’t use his Super to dash over water, and the flames from his Super don’t recharge his Super.
Gadget: Speed Zone
"Stu drops a booster that makes himself, his teammates, and other allies move faster while inside of it's area of effect."

When activated, Stu drops a turret with 1000 health that increases the movement speed of Stu and his allies in a 6.67 tile radius around it by 100 points. This doesn’t stack with other speed-boost abilities and doesn’t affect spawnables like Nita's bear or Mr. P's porters.

Gaso-Heal
"Using his Nitro Boost Super restores 500 of Stu's health."

When Stu uses his Super, he heals 500 health.
Tips

    Since Stu charges his Super with only one hit, despite being the slowest assassin, he can easily escape with his Super in dangerous situations and this makes him highly mobile. By attacking and using his Super in quick succession, Stu can be extremely great at dodging enemy fire. Stu can use his Super to dodge enemy fire, get another hit that recharges his Super, and use the Super again to escape unharmed. He can also dash up to collect items including Bolts in Siege or Gems in Gem Grab, making him viable in most events.
    In Brawl Ball or Trophy Thieves, Stu can be very useful, because he can self-pass by kicking the Ball/trophy ahead and dashing forward to retrieve it back, then continuously hitting the enemies from afar to recharge and chain Supers to boost him towards the respective item. This is better preformed with his Zero Drag Star Power.
    Stu should keep his Speed Zone Gadget behind a wall so it’s protected from enemies. This can also be used effectively at the team’s spawn point of the map, so when an ally is defeated, they can immediately get back into action. He can also use the turret as a temporary shield to block shots from enemies with mechanics that can’t hit multiple targets.
    When Stu’s Super is auto-aimed, he dashes in the direction that he is facing, similarly to how Shelly's Fast Forward Gadget and Max's Phase Shifter Gadget work. This is useful to escape or to engage long-ranged Brawlers, but is treacherous against close-ranged Brawlers. Thus, turning in the desired direction before dashing is helpful if you want to chain multiple Supers against someone.
    Stu can poke effectively by using his Super and his attack’s fast Super charge rate. He can fire a shot at an enemy, then dash backwards to avoid their counter fire. This recharges Stu's Super if the shot lands, allowing him to continuously poke, especially with his fast unload speed, and when they’re low on health, you can use your Super to get close and burst your attacks to finish them off. Poking is used best against close-ranged Brawlers, which are heavyweights, Shelly, Edgar, and Mortis. If the close-ranged Brawler catches up to Stu, he can easily hit them once and dash away with his Super, then continue poking them from a range, making Stu an ideal counter to close-ranged Brawlers.
    Stu is very viable in events where one’s intent is to eliminate the enemies like Bounty, Knockout, Lone Star, or Showdown/Duo Showdown due to his mechanics, but Stu's attack can’t pierce multiple targets. Because of this, the best way to use Stu in these events is to isolate your target, whether they’re solo or from their team. This way, Stu can thrive in the 1v1 situation by continuously poking at the enemy.
    With his Gaso-Heal Star Power, Stu can repeatedly use his attack and Super in quick succession to quickly heal in a pinch, since his Super charge rate and unload speed is so fast. You can use this to dash around and heal, as a temporary alternative to self-regeneration.
    Stu is decent in Big Game because he can dash around and dodge enemy fire, and he can burn the enemies with his Super as the Big Boss. As a Hunter, he can use his Speed Zone Gadget to allow other Hunters to circumvent obstacles to get to the Boss much faster or get back into action after being defeated, and he can continuously poke the Big Boss while dashing unpredictably and quickly. <br><br><br><br><br>

El Primo is a Rare Brawler that has the second-highest health of any Brawler in the game, a high damage output, and a fast movement speed. El Primo's Trait allows him to charge his Super from enemies dealing damage to him. He attacks by throwing a flurry of close-ranged, high-damaging punches. His Super makes him jump a long distance and crash down on enemies, which damages, knocks enemies back from his landing radius, and destroys cover. His first Gadget, Suplex Supplement, makes him grab enemies and fling them over his shoulders. His second Gadget, Asteroid Belt, summons a small meteor that deals high damage, knocks enemies back on impact, and destroys obstacles. His first Star Power, El Fuego, sets enemies hit by his Super on fire. His second Star Power, Meteor Rush, increases his movement speed after he uses his Super.

Trait
"This Brawler charges Super from damage received."

Whenever El Primo takes damage from an enemy Brawler, he charges his Super. The Super charge rate depends on the damage the enemy deals. It takes 20000 damage to charge a Super completely, and all damage is calculated after shielding and other effects.
Attack: Fists of Fury
"El Primo fires off a furious flurry of four fiery fists. That's a spicy jalapeno knuckle sandwich!"

El Primo fires a burst of four punches at a very short range, dealing high damage in total. El Primo must be quite close to damage his targets with all four punches, in spite of his already short range, but his punches can pierce multiple targets. The attack takes 0.8 seconds to complete and reloads very fast, allowing him to consistently damage enemies he’s close to.
Super: Flying Elbow Drop
"Leaping high, El Primo drops an Intergalactic Elbow that knocks around enemies and destroys cover!"

El Primo's Super makes him jump to a designated location, dealing high damage and destroying obstacles and also knocking enemies back in a small landing radius. His Super is useful for El Primo to get into range of enemies, thereby allowing him to attack them, to escape from enemies when he’s in danger, or to secure items such as Gems in Gem Grab and Bolts in Siege. While in the air, El Primo is completely immune to all damage aside from status effects and damage applied over time.
Gadgets
Suplex Supplement
"El Primo grabs the closest enemy within his reach and flips them like a pancake over his broad shoulders."

El Primo flings enemies over his shoulders. This stuns the enemy and El Primo can throw them over obstacles. He can only activate this Gadget if an enemy is within 3 tiles from him, and the enemy travels 6 tiles away from their original location unless obstacles block their trajectory. He can’t throw enemies with an invulnerability shield after they respawn.
Asteroid Belt
"El Primo summons a small meteor to strike the nearest enemy. It deals 2000 damage and destroys walls."

Upon activation, El Primo summons a small meteor that deals 2000 damage, destroys obstacles, and knocks enemies back in a 3.33 tile blast radius. There is a 3-second delay where the area-of-effect is highlighted, and the meteor targets the closest enemy to El Primo within 10 tiles.
Star Powers
El Fuego
"Enemies caught in El Primo's Super will burn for 1200 damage over 4 seconds."

El Primo glows fiery orange and his Super sets fire to enemies that were hit by his Super at the landing radius. This burn deals a total of 1200 damage over 4 seconds, or 300 damage per second. It’s mechanically similar to Crow's and Byron's poison effects.
Meteor Rush
"El Primo gains a 25% speed boost for 4.0 seconds after using his Super."

Once El Primo lands after using his Super, his speed is increased by 25% for 4 seconds.
Tips

    El Primo can deal high damage but his attacks are short-ranged. To defeat long-ranged Brawlers, players must find a way to maneuver El Primo into range and dodge the enemy’s shots, before the enemy Brawler can move farther, or they can eliminate El Primo before he can deal any damage. However, El Primo's Super allows him to traverse a long distance, making it effective to get closer to enemies and being able to attack them. Because of this, you can also justify this strategy with your Trait. First, charge your Super with El Primo’s Trait by allowing the enemy to attack you, then once your Super is charged up, you can jump onto them and defeat them.
    When facing shotgunners such as Bull, Darryl, or Shelly (without Super), El Primo should only attack them with the tip of his range. That way, those Brawlers can't hit all their projectiles, which lowers their damage and slows their Super charge. This requires caution and and knowledge of if it’s a safe situation to attack, as Shelly can dash in or escape with her Fast Forward Gadget or have her Super charged up. Bull/Darryl may also either escape using their Supers or use their respective Stomper/Tar Barrel Gadgets to catch up to El Primo. Otherwise, it’s better to ambush them with El Primo’s Super, because these Brawlers will be surprised and they’ll take high damage from his Super, especially with his El Fuego Star Power, allowing you to defeat them much easier. You can also use El Primo’s Super to evade Shelly’s destructive Super by jumping over it, but this requires precise timing.
    El Primo is very viable in Brawl Ball due to his abilities such as his high health and fast movement speed. He can self-pass if you have his Super charged up. Use your high health to get within Super range of the goal, then kick the Ball towards the goal and then use your Super to get to the ball, knocking away enemies and also clearing any obstacles and the goalpost, then retrieving the Ball and scoring a goal. With the Meteor Rush Star Power, he can get to the goal much faster after self-passing, which justifies using this strategy even more. You may also use your Asteroid Belt Gadget to destroy obstacles around the goalpost and knocking back defending enemies, also giving you a goal. El Primo's Super is also effective in knocking the Ball out of the enemy's grasp and dealing moderate damage, though this can circumvent if the enemy kicks the ball just before El Primo leaps. These strategies can almost guarantee a positive outcome.
    In Brawl Ball, you must choose whether to use your Suplex Supplement Gadget or your Super wisely. To knock the ball away from an enemy regularly, use his Suplex Supplement Gadget. This is because it’s more reliable than his Super and doesn’t destroy your own obstacles and your own goalpost. However, in overtime, the Super is more reliable as enemies are more likely to stay out of your Suplex Supplement Gadget’s range, and there aren’t any obstacles you’ll risk destroying if using your Super.
    El Primo is very useful in Heist because with his Super, he can jump onto the safe and start rapidly punching it without needing to go around the safe's obstacles. Also, he can use the jump to eliminate or knockback enemies and destroy the obstacles around the safe, allowing other teammates to reach the safe easily. He can deal higher damage with his El Fuego Star Power, dealing 1200 damage and/or his Asteroid Belt Gadget dealing 2000 damage, while also destroying more obstacles.
    When playing El Primo in Gem Grab, he can be used to knock enemies back, allowing for his team to control the Gem mine and collect Gems quickly. El Primo’s high health makes him also decent as the Gem Carrier, because he won’t be defeated easily while holding Gems, and his Super helps him escape from any approaching enemies.
    His El Fuego Star Power has the ability to prevent enemies in his landing radius from healing for an additional 4 seconds, raising the required time for a Brawler to start auto-regeneration from 3 seconds to 7 seconds, similar to Crow’s poison.
    When playing Duo Showdown with a non-random teammate, it’s best to pair El Primo with either versatile healers like Byron, Pam, and Poco or long-ranged support units like 8-BIT, Colt, Rico, or Brock to increase the chances of victory. El Primo can protect these Brawlers with his health while they support him by attacking the enemy from a range and/or healing him.
    His Suplex Supplement can displace enemy Brawlers, stunning them for the airborne duration and sending them back significantly. This is especially useful in Brawl Ball to remove enemy defenders from their goal, or stop approaching enemies from walking the Ball to your own goal and scoring, or to quickly escape from enemies when you don’t have your Super charged up. He can also use the Gadget to collect Siege Bolts by throwing them a fair distance away before they can collect the Bolt. If the conditions are right, El Primo can also use his Suplex Supplement Gadget to eliminate enemies with the poison gas in Showdown by standing near it so that he can then throw any nearby enemies into the gas.
    The asteroid from El Primo's Asteroid Belt Gadget attacks the Brawler closest to him. While enemies try to dodge the asteroid, the direction of their movement becomes very predictable, making them easy targets for his Super or allies. It can also be used to hit an enemy taking cover behind obstacles, which opens up enemy cover. Keep in mind that an teammate of yours (i.e. Tick) or El Primo himself might need specific obstacles to properly function regularly or on a certain map.
    El Primo does decent in Robo Rumble with his abilities. His attack’s mechanics such as the attack’s piercing, fast reload speed, fast unload speed, and high damage output allow El Primo to consistently and effectively defend the safe. His fast movement speed, Meteor Rush Star Power, and Super also useful to catch up to robots and eliminate them quickly. His Suplex Supplement Gadget is very useful to throw enemies out of the safe’s area, giving an extra few seconds to eliminate the robots, and this can affect the outcome drastically.
    El Primo is very versatile in Hot Zone, as with all heavyweights. He can deal high damage to enemies with his attack inside the zones, but his Super is his most useful asset. You can use his Super to traverse to zones much faster, and his Super deals high damage to enemies and knock them out of the zone. His Suplex Supplement Gadget can also throw enemies out of a zone, as the extra few seconds can affect the match outcome drastically. Additionally, his Asteroid Belt Gadget can be used for area control by forcing enemies out of the zone due to the asteroid and it’s high damage.
    You can try a strategy in maps with an abundance of bushes in which you keep spamming your Suplex Supplement Gadget in a large bush area in which you know there’s an enemy in it. When that enemy comes near you, your Suplex Supplement Gadget activates and will immediately throw that Brawler back, surprising them in the process and giving you ample time to take advantage of this. Using this to determine their position and Brawler being used, you can then plan your next move (attacking them or retreating). This works especially in Showdown (in maps like Dark Passage, NruhC nrevaC, and Cavern Churn). <br><br><br><br><br>

Rosa is a Rare Brawler who has very high health and a high damage output. Her attack is a flurry of three short-ranged punches with her boxing gloves that can pierce through enemies. Her Super grants her a temporary shield that reduces any damage she takes by 70%. Her first Gadget, Grow Light, spawns bushes around herself that any Brawler can hide in. Her second Gadget, Unfriendly Bushes, instantly damages and slows all enemies hiding in bushes. Her first Star Power, Plant Life, heals her slightly over time when she is in bushes. Her second Star Power, Thorny Gloves, adds additional damage to her attack while her Super is active.
Attack: Hands of Stone
"Rosa throws a flurry of powerful punches with perfect technique!"

Rosa fires off three short-ranged punches in a wide arc, dealing moderately high damage. Since her attack range is rather short, Rosa has to get up close to her targets in order to damage them. Her attacks can pierce multiple enemies. The attack takes 1.05 seconds to complete, which slightly hinders her ability to deal immediate damage.

Super: Strong Stuff
"Rosa gets a second skin of tough vine for 3 seconds, decreasing all damage received by 70% for the duration."

Upon activation, Rosa gains a shield for 3 seconds, along with an altered appearance. This shield reduces any damage she takes by 70%.
Gadgets
Grow Light
"Rosa fertilizes the ground around her and bushes instantly grow to provide great cover."

Upon activation, Rosa instantly grows a 3-by-3 section of green bushes where she is standing. These bushes last for the rest of the match unless they are destroyed by any obstacle-destroying ability (like Colt's Super), the Supers of Sprout or Amber, after a goal is scored in Brawl Ball, or after a round is over in Knockout. They can’t grow inside obstacles or beneath the safe in Heist.
Unfriendly Bushes
"All opponents hiding in bushes take 100 damage and get slowed down for 3 seconds."

When activated, enemies inside bushes immediately take 100 damage and get slowed for 3 seconds. The damage briefly reveals them.
Star Powers
Plant Life
"Rosa recovers 200 health per second when inside a bush."

Whenever Rosa is inside of a bush, she heals for 200 health every second.
Thorny Gloves
"Rosa's punches gain +220 damage during her Super."

While Rosa's Super is active, Rosa's attack gains an extra 220 damage, effectively making her damage 864 per punch and a total of 2592 damage if all 3 punches hit.
Tips

    Rosa thrives in Showdown. When using her Super, she can take on Brawlers like Bull, Darryl, and Shelly who would normally defeat her in a close-quarters combat encounter by utilizing the enormous damage reduction provided by her Super and still expect to come out on top, but you’ll still need to be wary of Shelly’s Super and her ability to chain it. Rosa is also an excellent bush camper when her Plant Life first Star Power is equipped. With her Plant Life equipped, she can hide in bushes where she heals and attack while healing when an enemy comes by.
    In Brawl Ball, use her Super before collecting the ball and then running into the goalpost to score. Her high health makes her very viable in Brawl Ball. However, be mindful when trying to walk the ball into the goal: many Brawlers have Supers or other abilities which can stun or knock you back, thereby preventing you from scoring. Watch out for those Brawlers such as Frank, Shelly, Tara, Bibi, etc.
    Rosa and El Primo have the same movement speed, but Rosa's range is slightly longer and wider, meaning that she’s able to escape and attack him while being out of his range. This technique can also be used when dealing with enemy Rosas. Walk away from the enemy while also attacking towards them, and they should walk into your punches.
    Her Super has an extremely high damage resistance but has a somewhat short duration so make sure not to overestimate it’s power, especially if her health is low. If you are dealing with a Brawler you know you can't defeat for whatever reason, such as Bull (without her Super) immediately activate the Super when they get close in order to resist losing by taking large amounts of damage. This gives you a better chance of staying alive or even defeating the enemy.
    If she can surprise the other team (in any mode) while her Super is active, she can continuously chain Supers, wiping their team. However, remember the shield doesn’t make her invincible and it’s possible for defeat against a high-damaging team composition in the space in which it is down, such as one of those teammates being a Nani.
    Rosa's Plant Life Star Power allows her to heal 200 health per second while in a bush. Be sure to use this when battling another Rosa which allows her to out-heal the enemy while still damaging them. In maps with a lot of bushes, she’ll be difficult to eliminate, especially in Snake Prairie, Island Invasion, and NruhC nrevaC. She can even use Plant life to counter tick damage, such as Crow's or Byron’s poison and El Primo's El Fuego Star Power. Even without Plant Life, Rosa can still prove to be above-average when hiding in bushes.
    It is advisable to use Rosa’s Plant Life Star Power on maps where there are many bushes and her Thorny Gloves Star Power on maps where there is less cover.
    In Duo Showdown, be sure to have a team composition that can cover Rosa's weaknesses. The most obvious choices are any mid/long ranged Brawlers, these include Brock, Piper, Colt, or even Carl in some maps.
    Her Super can save her in tough situations due to the high damage decrease. Use her Super when fighting another Brawler that might knock her out.
    Rosa’s Grow Light Gadget can be used to add and connect bushes to make it easier for her to ambush opponents. When paired with her Plant Life Star Power, Rosa can use her Grow Light Gadget to passively heal herself when wounded in battle.
    When fighting another Rosa, don't use a lot of ammo when their shield is up. Instead, wait until the effect stops so you won't waste your ammo.
    Rosa's Unfriendly Bushes Gadget can be used to briefly reveal all enemies hiding within a bush due to it dealing 100 damage with infinite range. If the enemy revealed is close to her, she’ll be able to view and catch up to the enemy and defeat them easily due to the slowing effect from the Gadget unless the enemy has an ability to increase their movement speed, has an ability to decrease her movement speed, or has enough damage and health to take her out before she could do so when she doesn't have her Super charged up.
    Rosa is a heavyweight, so she counters assassins like Edgar, Crow, Leon, Stu, and Mortis. With the exception of Edgar, you can usually engage these Brawlers at 1-tile distance and come out on top, so always maintain close quarters with them. In the case of Edgar, keep a few tiles distance because he out-damages Rosa, but she out-ranges him.
    As a tank, Rosa is countered by control Brawlers, which can push, knockback, pull, slow, or stun with their Supers. These are mid-range Brawlers that have high damage and usually low health, such as Emz and Spike. Usually, try to avoid these Brawlers unless you know the odds are in your favor.
    Rosa's best 3v3 modes are Gem Grab and Hot Zone. She works well as a Gem carrier in Gem Grab because of her movement speed, healing abilities, and high health. She can also be used to protect and tank shots for allies Gem carriers (don’t try to tank if the enemy has a Jessie, Penny, Surge, or Belle). Because she is good in close-quarters combat encounters but outranges the other melee Brawlers in the game, she’s also a good choice for Hot Zone. She’s also a decent pick for Bounty, Siege and Heist due to her high health, survivability, and high damage output (with the exception of Snake Prairie). <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/2/24/Poco_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20210407002227" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Poco is a Rare Brawler who has moderate-high health and a low damage output, but can provide immense healing to allies. For his attack, Poco plays his guitarrón, sending musical notes within a wide spread and range. His Super fires a larger musical wave, healing himself and any allies within its range. His first Gadget, Tuning Fork, heals him and nearby allies in a circular radius for a considerable duration. His second Gadget, Protective Tunes, cleanses all status effects and protects all allies from those effects momentarily. His first Star Power, Da Capo!, allows Poco’s normal attack to heal allies. His second Star Power, Screeching Solo, allows his Super to deal low damage to enemies.
Attack: Power Chord
"Poco strums his guitarrón, sending forward bone-jarring sound waves. Enemies hit by the waves take damage."

Poco releases a wave from his guitarrón that takes the appearance of musical notes. The attack has medium range, but it spreads out drastically as it travels, allowing it to cover a very large area in front of or behind Poco and pierce multiple enemies caught in the area, but deals low damage. However, he cannot attack through walls.

Super: Encore
"Poco heals himself and all friends he can reach with his uplifting melody. Does not affect enemies."

When his Super is used, he shoots a larger musical wave from his guitarrón that heals him and any allies hit by the wave. The wave is much wider and longer than his attack, but is the same cone shape as his attack. This can travel through any Brawler or obstacle. Poco's Super will appear green regardless of their team. Poco's Super can't heal minions summoned by allies though(e.g, Mr.P 's porters , or Nita's bear.)
Gadgets
Tuning Fork
"Poco and all nearby allies heal 400 health per second for 5 seconds."

Poco releases music in a 3.33 tile radius around him. Poco and allies that stand within that radius are healed 400 health per second even after they leave that radius. If it lasts for the entire 5 seconds, Poco and his teammates can heal a total of 2000 health.
Protective Tunes
"Removes active adverse effects from friendly brawlers in a large area and gives a 1.0 second immunity."

Poco cleanses all allied Brawlers in a 6 tile radius. This removes poisons, burns, stuns, slows, and Lou's Frost. It doesn’t protect Brawlers from knockbacks and El Primo's Suplex Supplement Gadget. After Brawlers are cleansed, they will be immune to these effects for 1 second.
Star Powers
Da Capo!
"When Poco's attack hits friendly Brawlers they now heal for 700 health."

This allows Poco to only heal allied Brawlers for 700 health with his attack while simultaneously damaging enemy Brawlers, similar to Byron‘s attacks, but the attack’s healing isn’t affected by Power Cubes.
Screeching Solo
"Poco's Super now also hits enemies, dealing 800 damage."

Poco's Super will deal 800 damage to enemy Brawlers in range, on top of the healing to allies. Note that auto-aiming your Super still aims it towards allies instead of enemies.
Tips

    Poco is great at supporting other Brawlers that have more firepower due to his ability to heal them using his Super, his Tuning Fork Gadget, and his Da Capo! Star Power.
    Remember, Poco's attack has a wide spread but doesn’t deal much damage. This means he’s not used as a front line attacker, but rather used for effective support. The spread allows him to hit multiple targets at once and charge his Super quickly. The wide spread of his attack also allows him to check large bushes.
    When using Poco’s Da Capo! Star Power, try lining up his shots so you can chain attacks to heal allies and damage enemies simultaneously, similar to how you use Byron’s Injection Star Power. This is the best way to get the most value out of the Star Power, and gives your team more survivability whilst weakening enemies.
    Remember to fire Poco's Super toward teammates to heal them, or you’ll waste your Super to heal only yourself unless you have the Screeching Solo Star Power when you can use your Super offensively.
    Poco's attacks can be released in quick succession, allowing him to attack an enemy Brawler multiple times to charge his Super quickly before retreating to reload again, or heal a teammate in quick succession with his Da Capo! Star Power.
    Poco's healing abilities are more useful than Pam's in tight situations when you or your teammates have almost no health left, as Pam's Super takes time, while Poco's is instant, not to mention in a way larger area. This makes him considerably more useful than Pam in Brawl Ball and Bounty.
    Poco is amazing with high-health Brawlers such as heavyweights, as Poco can continuously replenish their health while they keep Poco safe from stronger Brawlers, and control the map. Using Poco's Tuning Fork gadget and Poco's Da Capo! star power will be more ideal in this case,since with them, Poco can heal allies even without his super.
    It is advised to use Screeching Solo when playing Showdown, Lone Star, or Takedown due to the lack of teammates. This Star Power is especially effective if Poco has his Super charged while standing with multiple low-health enemies.
    Poco with other healers can be very good at healing. Poco could constantly heal Pam or Byron and vice versa. <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/3/3c/Barley_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20200331165158" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Barley is a Rare Brawler who has rather low health but high damage potential. He attacks by throwing a bottle of harmful liquid that splashes onto the ground and creates a small puddle on the ground, dealing damage to enemies splashed and inside the puddle over time. His Super fires five similar bottles which cover a greater area and persist for a longer time. His first Gadget, Sticky Syrup Mixer, creates a sticky puddle around himself, slowing enemies down. His second Gadget, Herbal Tonic, throws bottles around himself and teammates that heal them if they stand on the puddles. His first Star Power, Medical Use, heals him slightly when he throws his bottle with his attack. His second Star Power, Extra Noxious, adds additional damage per second to his main attack. Barley and his Wizard skin can be unlocked for free by linking an account to Supercell ID.
 
Attack: Undiluted
"Barley lobs a bottle, breaking it on the ground. Enemies take damage from the splash, and more damage over time if they stay in the puddle."

Barley throws a bottle of liquid that shatters and deals damage to enemy Brawlers who are standing in the 2 tile radius that the liquid covers. The damage can hit twice if the enemy remains standing on the liquid. After 2 seconds, the liquid disappears.
Super: Last Call
"Barley hurls a flurry of fiery bottles, covering a huge area in flames. This one's on the house!"

Barley throws several bottles of flaming liquid that cover a very large area and deal more damage over time. It is mechanically very similar to Barley's main attack but lasts 4 seconds; the damage can hit multiple times if the enemy remains standing on the liquid, and after a short time, the liquid disappears. The spread of the bottles slightly increase the farther they are thrown. The Super takes 1.25 seconds to complete.
Gadgets
Sticky Syrup Mixer
"Barley drops a sticky concoction that leaves a puddle, slowing down all enemies that makes contact with it."

Barley drops a bottle of liquid at his feet that slows down enemies that walk into it. The puddle lasts for 4 seconds and slows down enemies in a 3.33 tile radius. The puddle remains even after Barley is defeated.
Herbal Tonic
"Barley throws a healing potion at nearby allies that creates an area that heals for 500 health per second."

Barley drops a bottle of liquid at his and teammates' feet within 10 tiles of his location that heals 500 health per second. The puddles last for 4.5 seconds and affect all Brawlers in a 2.67 tile radius. The puddles remain even after Barley is defeated. They heal himself and all teammates immediately, allowing them to heal at maximum 2500 health per puddle.
Star Powers
Medical Use
"Barley regains 400 health from each attack."

Whenever Barley throws a bottle from his main attack, he regains 400 health. The healing occurs even if Barley doesn't hit an opponent with the attack.
Extra Noxious
"Adds +200 damage per second to Barley's attack."

Barley's main attack's damage is increased by 200 damage for a total of 1180 damage per tick without any outside buffs.
Tips

    Like Dynamike and Tick, his attacks are thrown, giving him the ability to attack over walls. A good strategy is to attack from behind walls.
    Barley's attack makes it possible to discourage enemy movement through certain paths. Take advantage of this to keep enemies out of critical areas of the map, such as the mine in Gem Grab.
    Try to focus on aiming for choke points on the map, or where you think enemies are going to go. Barley is a very solid control Brawler, due to his attack staying on the field.
    Barley's Super can deal more damage if an enemy Brawler is unable to get out of the liquid quickly. Try to aim the Super to have it land with the enemy Brawler standing in the middle or trapped against a wall, and Sticky Syrup Mixer can prolong and maximize your damage output.
    Combining Barley's Super with Spike's can deal huge damage to enemy Brawlers trapped by both. Spike's Super slows the enemy's movement speed, hindering escape, while Barley's does damage.
    Barley is a menace in Duo Showdown if he is paired with a good tank, such as El Primo, Rosa or Bull. You can follow your partner around and use Barley's attack to damage opponents while the tank finishes them off. The same applies to Power Cubes; if there are multiple boxes near your spawn, you can use your attacks to break them by stacking their damage.
    Auto-aiming with Barley will often cause you to miss your shot or only get 1 tick of damage. Because Barley's attacks last for two ticks, if you aim the shot in front of an enemy towards where they want to go, you will either hinder their movement or cause them to take two ticks of damage.
    Barley is a great Siege Brawler mainly because he is a control Brawler, excellent at area denial. He forces the enemy team's Brawlers back with his long-lasting attacks and Super so that his team can get the bolts. When playing Barley in Siege, try to stay alive when your Siege Bot spawns. Barley is usually the primary damage dealer to the IKE. Additionally, Barley's Super is able to reach the IKE without entering its range.
    Barley can be effective in Heist, if used correctly. Barley's Super has an incredibly long range, allowing it to safely deal damage to the Heist safe. Since the Heist safe is a stationary target, it will take both ticks of damage from his main attack as well.
    Barley's Extra Noxious Star Power allows Barley's attacks to deal more damage. This makes Barley to become a more aggressive brawler and become very strong behind walls. This Star Power enables Barley to become very strong on modes like Heist and Siege.
    His Medical Use Star Power is more map-dependent, best used in game modes where controlling the field is more important than eliminating enemy Brawlers. This includes Gem Grab, Heist, and Siege . Medical Use increases his survivability, allowing you to keep attacking instead of retreating, giving up ground to heal up. This Star Power can be paired with his Herbal Tonic Gadget to provide healing when other healers aren’t on your team.
    Barley's Sticky Syrup Mixer Gadget can be more useful than one would assume. It can be used when defending a goal in Brawl Ball and can discourage tanks from chasing you. Surprisingly, you can use this to bush camp with Barley. Hide in a bush, and when an enemy walks by, use your Gadget to slow them and burst them down. If done correctly, this will either take out the enemy Brawler or deal tremendous amounts of damage, forcing them to retreat. Barley's Sticky Syrup Mixer Gadget is especially viable against tanks, since it usually slows them to the point where Barley can exit their range and deal a large amount of damage to them due to them not being able to evade both ticks of damage from his main attack. <br><br><br><br><br>
    SUPER RARE: <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/4/46/Carl_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20200315100242" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Carl is a Super Rare Brawler. He has decently high health and a moderate damage output. When he attacks, Carl boomerangs his pickaxe, damaging any enemies hit while the pickaxe is flying forward or traveling back to Carl, and he can’t attack until the pickaxe returns. His Super allows him to spin, which boosts his movement speed drastically but momentarily, dealing damage to anyone he hits. His first Gadget, Heat Ejector, dispenses a trail of hot rocks behind him that sets enemies who touch them on fire and burns them over time. His second Gadget, Flying Hook, makes Carl's next attack pull him to the furthest point of its range. His first Star Power, Power Throw, increases his pickaxe’s speed, effectively decreasing his reload time. His second Star Power, Protective Pirouette, grants him a significant damage reduction shield during his Super.
Attack: Pickaxe
"Carl throws his Pickaxe like a boomerang. After he catches the returning Pickaxe, he can throw it again."

Carl throws a pickaxe that deals damage to enemies both while flying forward and when returning to him. The pickaxe can return to Carl through walls, but can’t be thrown through walls. Carl's attack doesn’t reload like normal Brawlers, because once his pickaxe returns to him, Carl reloads his only ammo bar. However, if Carl's pickaxe hits a wall while travelling away from him, it will hit and bounce off the wall and return back to Carl. When Carl respawns, his only ammo will reload rather slowly. In Brawl Ball, Carl can shoot the Ball without using up ammo. Carl cannot use an attack more than once every 0.5 seconds.
Super: Tailspin
"Carl goes into a crazy spin for a few seconds, flailing around and damaging nearby opponents."

Carl spins his pickaxe, dealing damage to any targets he’s close to every 0.25 seconds. Carl's movement speed is doubled while using his Super. This effect lasts for 3 seconds and stops immediately when he’s stunned or knocked back.
Gadgets
Heat Ejector
"Carl drops a trail of hot rocks behind his cart! Opponents that touch them are set on fire, and receive a total of 1200 damage over time each."

When activated, Carl drops a pile of hot rocks behind him every 0.625 seconds for 5 seconds that each last for 3 seconds. Each pile of hot rocks can do a maximum of 1200 damage per rock hit. The number of rocks dropped is dependent on his speed; the quantity of rocks is increased if he moves while using his Super, and drops only one if he is stationary. The burning damage does not stack due to being hit by multiple rocks.
Flying Hook
"Carl's next attack makes his pickaxe pull him to the farthest point of the attack."

Carl's next attack makes him travel with his pickaxe to the furthest point of its range, allowing him to travel over lakes and through rope fences if those obstacles are in range. The attack stays slightly in front of him but will only deal damage once, and the pickaxe doesn’t return to Carl's old position. A Gadget symbol will glow above Carl's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick.
Star Powers
Power Throw
"Carl throws his Pickaxe with 12% more speed, allowing it to travel faster and return faster."

Carl's pickaxe projectile speed is increased by 312 points (12% faster than a normal attack). This also decreases the attack cooldown, allowing him to utilize walls better.
Protective Pirouette
"During Carl's Super, all damage he receives is reduced by 35%."

Carl shields all damage taken by 35% for the duration of his Super.
Tips

    When Carl's pickaxe hits an obstacle, it bounces off and returns, allowing Carl throw it again quicker. He can utilize this mechanic by pushing enemy Brawlers near a wall. Because his pickaxe will return faster after it hits the wall, Carl can do bursts of damage quickly, especially with his Power Throw Star Power, and he can utilize this to break Power Cube crates in Showdown. This can be highly effective in Heist where Carl can utilize walls near the enemy safe to deal consistent and quick damage.
    Carl's Super does a lot of damage but at a short-range. Be sure to get close to an enemy Brawler to maximize its damage, but it is advisable to avoid short-ranged Brawlers who deal damage quicker than Carl can.
    When using Carl's Super offensively, make sure to pay attention to the Super’s mechanics. Carl doesn’t have a shield like Rosa’s Super does, making him more likely to get burst down by enemy Brawlers. However, if he has his Protective Pirouette Star, he can partially protect himself during one, though it's still never recommended to go near close-ranged Brawlers like Bull with his Super to deal damage to them.
    Carl cannot use his main attack while using his Super, but he can still use his Super while his pickaxe is still flying.
    Carl's Super can be used to get possession of the ball quicker than anyone else can. However, Carl cannot pick up the ball while using his Super.
    Keep in mind that the pickaxe's returning ability may pose a disadvantage when attacking while traveling inside bushes. This gives the opponents ample time to perform prediction shots.
    Carl's Super makes him have one of the fastest movement speeds in the game. Use this to escape (especially helpful with the Protective Pirouette Star Power as it lets him survive more shots) or to reach low health enemies.
    When Carl's pickaxe returns, it can go through walls and obstacles. This can be crucial when opponents only need one more hit to be defeated but is hiding behind a wall. He can take advantage of this by throwing his pickaxe and moving towards the enemy behind the wall before it returns allowing it to get an indirect hit.
    Carl's Super can be interrupted by knockback or stun effects such as Gene's Super and Bibi's Home Run attack. Avoid using his Super offensively against Brawlers like these who can easily cancel his Super.
    Carl’s Heat Ejector Gadget can be used to block the path of incoming enemies in events such as Brawl Ball. It can also be paired with his Super to secure a lot of damage to the safe in Heist.
    Carl’s Flying Hook Gadget is useful for joining to action and retreating in events like Showdown, Gem Grab, and Siege, further helped by allowing him to travel over lakes and rope fences. It is also an excellent tool to counter defenseless Brawlers at close-quarters like Piper, especially if paired with his Super. It can also be used to escape from danger such as if you’re ambushed (i.e. Shelly. ) <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/6/66/Darryl_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20201117123209" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Darryl is a Super Rare Brawler who has high health and a high damage output. He attacks by shooting shotgun shells that deal very high damage at close-range. His Super allows him to roll for some distance, damaging enemies and bouncing off walls. His Trait helps his Super charge automatically over time. His first Gadget, Recoiling Rotator, makes Darryl spin around and shoot a barrage of pellets around him that slightly charge his Super. His second Gadget, Tar Barrel, emits tar around him that slows enemies. His first Star Power, Steel Hoops, grants him a drastic damage-reducing shield while using his Super. His second Star Power, Rolling Reload, momentarily doubles his reload speed after using his Super.
Trait
"This Brawler charges Super over time."

Darryl's Super will charge itself over time similarly to Edgar. It takes 30 seconds to fully charge his Super.
Attack: Double Deuce
"Darryl's double barrel shotguns fire two staggered blasts of heavy close-range damage."

Darryl fires 10 shells in 2 waves from his shotguns that deal medium-high damage. This attack deals more damage at close quarters because more shells can hit the enemy, dealing the highest consistent damage out of all Brawlers at point-blank range. This attack takes 0.8 seconds to complete.
Super: Barrel Roll
"Darryl rolls forward inside his barrel, knocking back enemies and bouncing off walls. His Super recharges over time!"

Darryl rapidly rolls a short distance, bouncing off walls; however, unlike Rico's attack and Super, the distance isn't increased after bouncing off a wall. He can roll through water, but not through rope fences or other obstacles. Enemies hit by a rolling Darryl get knocked back and take minor damage. Darryl can pierce through multiple enemies in one roll, and can hit the same enemy multiple times by bouncing off walls.
Gadgets
Recoiling Rotator
"Darryl spins around and sprays a barrage of shots in all directions. Each shot deals 400 damage and recharges his Super by 25% if it hits enemies!"

Darryl spins in a circle, quickly unloading 15 single shells around himself. Each shell deals 400 damage and has a range of 9 tiles. Each shell that hits an enemy charges 25% of his Super. This Gadget doesn’t hinder movement.
Tar Barrel
"Darryl creates a slowing area around himself for 5.0 seconds."

Darryl emits a wave of tar all around him. Its 2.67 tile radius is quite small, but it moves around with Darryl. Enemies inside its radius are slowed down. Tar Barrel lasts for five seconds and can still be used while using Darryl's Super. Just like Recoiling Rotator, Darryl isn’t immobile during the Gadget’s usage.
Star Powers
Steel Hoops
"Darryl's Super reinforces his barrel, reducing all damage he takes by 90% for 0.9 seconds."

While using his Super, Darryl is granted a shield that reduces damage taken by 90%. The shield lasts until Darryl stops rolling.
Rolling Reload
"When Darryl uses his Super, he doubles his reload speed for 5.0 seconds."

After Darryl uses his Super, he doubles his reload speed for 5 seconds, along with a slightly larger and reddened appearance.
Tips

    His movement speed is slightly faster than that of most other Brawlers since he is a Heavyweight. Due to this, retreating/approaching is easier and often safer due to his ability to dodge shots.
    His Super is great for quickly escaping enemies/dangerous situations or getting closer to enemies, and Darryl rolls extremely quickly. It’s also worth noting that you can increase the range of his roll if you happen to roll over water. This is vital when escaping enemies, as the water could help in getting away from tough situations (in maps like Acid Lakes or Canal Grande, etc.).
    In Brawl Ball, he can be quite useful by self-passing, by kicking the ball forward and using his Super to roll into and retrieve the Ball. You can use it for retrieving the Ball from the center after either team scores, but note that it puts him in the middle of the fight and likely results in him being defeated. You can also use his Super on an enemy who’s carrying the Ball, which knocks it from their possession and knocks them back. This can be used to defend the goal by delaying an enemy who’s about to score.
    An effective way to use Darryl is to charge his Super and reload all your ammo, use it to roll into an enemy, and auto-aim all of his ammo. This deals a decent amount of damage and can even result in a defeat, (if the enemy in question isn’t a heavyweight or doesn’t have a high amount of Power Cubes in Showdown), charging his Super fully again to roll back if done correctly.
    If timed properly while rolling on to an opponent, Darryl's Super can cancel an enemy’s Super due to the knockback, like how Frank's Super can be cancelled with Shelly's Super. This becomes useful when attacking other Brawlers with Darryl who have their Supers ready (like Frank).
    Darryl's Super can hit multiple times when fighting in confined areas (which is optimal for Darryl as a heavyweight). Aim his Super to ricochet off walls and rack up damage on your enemies.
    When confronting enemies in point-blank range, be mindful of your positioning and don't go through them as the second shot of Darryl's attack can completely miss.
    At extremely close/point-blank range, Darryl has one of the highest-damaging attacks out of any Brawler in the game, dealing 3360 damage for the shots combined (1680 each) at max level. While Darryl shouldn't rely on this unless bush-camping or using his Super to get close to enemies, he handles close-ranged Brawlers such as El Primo fairly well.
    Darryl's main attack deals a lot of damage but not consistently. When targeting someone with his Super, make sure he actually rolls into them and hits them. If he’s too close, he might roll over them. If he’s too far, he can hit them but won’t be within bursting range. Tar Barrel's slowing effect allows him to catch up to enemies in case his Super misses by a few tiles.
    In maps with a plethora of bushes, use Darryl’s Recoiling Rotator Gadget to scout out the area. You can find enemies easier that way. The Gadget is also very useful for attacking the enemy safe in Heist. Position yourself right in the center of the safe and activate the Gadget as quickly as possible, rolling clockwise a little to ensure that every shell hits.
    The damage reduction granted by Steel Hoops allows Darryl to safely roll onto long-ranged Brawlers, because the massive damage reduction renders defensive shots against him useless while using his Super. Steel Hoops also notably makes him effective against Tick, allowing him to roll through patches of mines unharmed in a dire situation, and also easily defuse Tick's Super.
    Darryl's Rolling Reload Star Power allows him to ambush and defeat heavyweights more easily with his Super, because it can drastically increase his damage output. He can also use this to roll onto the enemy safe in Heist and deal extreme amounts of damage. <br><br><br><br><br>

Jacky is a Super Rare Brawler with high health and a moderately high but inconsistent damage output. She has a Trait that allows her to charge her Super from enemies damaging Jacky. She attacks with her jackhammer, which smashes the ground and instantly deals moderately high damage in a circular area-of-effect around her. Her Super pulls in enemies in a large radius and grants her a shield for the duration of her Super. Her Gadget, Pneumatic Booster, briefly increases her movement speed. Her first Star Power, Counter Crush, converts an amount of any incoming damage and reflects back at surrounding enemies. Her second Star Power, Hardy Hard Hat, passively reduces any and all damage she takes by 10%.
Trait
"This Brawler charges Super from damage received."

Whenever Jacky takes damage from an enemy Brawler, she will charge her Super. The Super charge rate depends on the damage the enemy deals. It takes 20000 damage to charge a Super completely, and all damage is calculated after shielding and other effects.

Attack: Groundbreaker
"Jacky hops on her Jackhammer to shake the ground all around. Enemies caught too close will get a pounding!"

Jacky damages all enemies in a radius around her, including enemies behind walls. The damage is dealt immediately without any travel time, but Jacky has a relatively slow reload speed and attack cooldown. There is no direction of travel to this attack, so aiming is not required, though aiming can be used to show you the area-of-effect.
Super: Holey Moley!
"Jacky drills a hole in the ground, pulling in foes to introduce them to her Jackhammer! She partially shields incoming attacks while performing her Super."

Jacky pulls in enemies in a radius around her after 0.5 seconds, granting her a shield that momentarily halves all damage she receives. Just like Jacky's attack, aiming is not required, but there’s an area-of-effect displayed if you aim. Enemies in bushes and invisible enemies like Leon will be revealed if they are pulled.
Gadget: Pneumatic Booster
"Jacky gets a burst of energy and moves 20% faster for 3.0 seconds."

This Gadget allows Jacky to temporarily move faster than usual for 3 seconds. This doesn’t stack with other speed boosts.
Star Powers
Counter Crush
"When receiving damage, Jacky returns the favor by converting 30% of the damage into a Groundbreaker counterattack."

Any time Jacky is damaged, she will spontaneously perform a counterattack similar to her attack. It has a radius of 4 tiles, and it damages for 30% of the damage Jacky received. This won't consume ammo, and Counter Crush doesn’t trigger Counter Crush on an opposing Jacky.
Hardy Hard Hat
"Jacky's Hard Hat protects her by reducing any damage she takes by 10%."

This passively reduces all damage she takes by 10% for the full duration of the match, allowing her to withstand up to around 7778 damage without any outside buffs. It does not stack with the shield from her Super and the Super shield will take effect over this ability.
Tips

    Jacky's short range limits her offensive capabilities, but she has enough range to attack enemies that are at least a tile behind walls, which she can use to her advantage by attacking enemies behind walls. This strictly limits throwers that can otherwise take cover behind walls.
    Jacky's attack circles around her, which means that she can attack behind her, so if an enemy approaches you from behind, you can still hit them, as long as they are close to you. However, keep in mind that her attack is instantaneous, so you cannot run to extend your range.
    Jacky has the same movement speed as other heavyweights. This means that she can catch up to Brawlers that are escaping from her. If she has her Pneumatic Booster Gadget, this can be useful when chasing other fast Brawlers like Max and will help in game modes like Brawl Ball, Bounty and Showdown. With her high health as well, she can rush enemies and defeat them easily. However, be wary of slowing Gadgets and Supers.
    The quick burst of speed from her Pneumatic Booster Gadget is helpful to position Jacky quickly, escape in dangerous situations or when low on health, hunt enemies down, or secure vital items like Bolts in Siege or Gems in Gem Grab.
    Jacky can use her Super to pull in enemies before using her attack since she requires to be close to enemies to damage them. Note that her ammo won’t recharge during her Super, so make sure to reload all your ammo before you use her Super. Jacky's Super can also be used to interrupt potentially dangerous Supers (like Carl's or Frank's).
    In Brawl Ball, if an enemy holding the Ball gets caught in her Super, the Ball drops. This allows teammates to quickly steal the Ball or prevent an enemy from scoring. In addition, Jacky has a high damage output, high health, and a fast movement speed, which is better justified with her Pneumatic Booster Gadget, making Jacky very viable in this event.
    Jacky’s attack is unique; auto-aiming or manually aiming renders the same attack direction and range. Because of this, players can focus on other aspects of the match such as dodging attacks and positioning.
    In Showdown, Jacky's circular area damage mechanics along with her high damage is useful in some maps to destroy large groups of Power Cube Boxes in maps like Feast or Famine, Dark Passage, Two Thousand Lakes and Acid Lakes. However, since her range is short like other heavyweights, she should prioritize getting Power Cubes and should avoid immediate conflict with other Brawlers.
    Jacky, despite being a heavyweight, cannot match other heavyweights. This is because she reloads rather slowly and doesn’t deal enough damage to eliminate such Brawlers with three ammo. Since all other heavyweights reload faster and/or deal more damage than her (like Bull), she can neither defeat heavyweights in three shots nor can she reload fast enough to get a fourth one before getting eliminated. Jacky should therefore focus on picking on low-medium health Brawlers or low-damaging and slow-reloading ones. If a Brawler reloads slower or deals less damage, Jacky can eliminate them easily as she has high health and can withstand three to five of their shots. In addition, make sure that the enemy has exhausted all their ammo so you can get close to them without taking major damage from being out-ranged.
    When trying to pull an enemy with your Super, try to drag the joystick to know if you are going to pull the enemy or not. Otherwise you risk exposing yourself to enemy fire due to the fact that the Super makes you immobile.
    Due to Jacky’s short range, she isn’t ideal for extremely open maps such as Purple Paradise in Bounty, where long-ranged Brawlers will outrange her and fend Jacky off. If playing Jacky on an open map, use her Hardy Hard Hat Star Power because she can rush enemies and dodge their shots, and she can withstand more damage. Her Counter Crush Star Power is less useful since its range won’t be enough to defeat long-ranged Brawlers from a range. <br><br><br><br><br>

Penny is a Super Rare Brawler with medium health and a long-range attack that deals splash damage when it hits a target. Her Super deploys a mortar with low health that lobs high-damaging, ranged cannonballs. Her first Gadget, Pocket Detonator, blows up her cannon , damaging and knocking back enemies caught in the explosion. Her second Gadget, Captain's Compass, calls a cannonball strike on her location. Her first Star Power, Last Blast, allows her cannon to shoot high-damaging and long-ranged cannonballs at enemies upon being destroyed. Her second Star Power, Balls of Fire, allows her cannonballs to briefly set the ground on fire upon landing, dealing moderate damage to enemies that stay in the burning area.

Attack: Plunderbuss
"Shoots out a pouch of fool's gold. If the pouch hits an enemy, it bursts and coins pepper targets behind the first enemy."

Penny's main attack shoots a medium-sized pouch of gold out of her blunderbuss. If it hits, it will additionally spray three clumps of golden coins behind the target in a cone shaped area that travel for 4 tiles, piercing opponents and dealing the same damage as the pouch for each clump of gold. With this, she can deal double or even triple the damage. However, the pouch itself deals relatively low damage and has a slow unload and reload speed.
Super: Old Lobber
"Penny sets up her cannon! It can shoot at enemies at a long range, even if they are behind cover."

When her Super is used, Penny drops a cannon with high damage and low health. This turret can be thrown anywhere within a short distance from Penny. The turret is stationary and fires cannonballs over obstacles that deal area damage to enemies. The firing range is extremely long, however, it has a rather slow firing rate, and the cannonballs have a slow travel speed which make them easy to dodge. Unlike many lobbed attacks, the travel time of the cannon does not decrease depending on the distance.
Gadgets
Pocket Detonator
"Penny blows her cannon! The explosion destroys walls and deals 1500 damage to nearby enemies."

Upon activation, her cannon blows up, damaging and pushing back enemies near it in a 2.67 tile radius. This also destroys walls and bushes. The Gadget can only be used if there is an active cannon within 12 tiles of her current location. This Gadget can trigger her Last Blast Star Power.
Captain's Compass
"Penny calls an artillery strike from her Cannon to her current location."

Upon activation, Penny's cannon shoots out a barrage of 5 cannonballs to her location. The strike is X-shaped with the center cannonball striking last. The Gadget can only be used if there is an active cannon within 14 tiles of where she is standing. This Gadget will stop early if Penny is defeated before the last cannonball is shot, and the cannonballs from this Gadget are affected by her Balls of Fire Star Power.
Star Powers
Last Blast
"When Penny's Cannon is destroyed, it shoots out one last barrage of 4 bombs targeting nearby enemies, each dealing 1680 damage."

When the cannon is destroyed or replaced by another cannon, it will fire 4 cannonballs, each dealing 1680 damage to the closest enemy that destroys the cannon and also enemies in range. This Star Power can be triggered by her Pocket Detonator Gadget.
Balls of Fire
"Cannonballs from Penny's turret set the ground on fire for 3 seconds. Enemies in the burning area take 400 damage per second!"

When Penny's cannonballs hit an enemy, it will create a burning effect for 3 seconds that acts just like Barley's main attack, but is two seconds longer. If the enemy is in the burning area, they'll take 400 damage per second for a total of 1200 damage. The burning damage can stack. This Star Power affects the cannonballs shot by her Captain's Compass Gadget.
Tips

    When an opponent is positioned behind another opponent with high health, the splash effect of Penny’s main attack is able to hit both of them. This makes her very effective against any Brawler that uses their Super as a sort of shield, like Mr. P's Porters or Nita's Big Baby Bear.
    Penny's cannon forces players to keep moving around the map. Use this to your advantage to predict where your opponents will be moving.
    To maximize the lifespan of the cannon turret, one of the very optimal placements for it is behind walls on the player's side of the map. The turret's extremely long range allows it to shoot cannonballs to the enemy's side of the map from the safety of the player's side and it is protected from enemy fire when behind walls.
    Like Jessie, Penny's Super can act as a shield in a pinch, absorbing enemy fire for a while and allowing herself or an ally to escape from a dangerous situation. It is even more effective combined with Pocket Detonator, which deals 1500 damage and knocks the enemy back, even triggering her Last Blast Star Power if equipped.
    Penny's pouch will not burst upon impact with walls or other obstacles. Her attack will, however, burst upon impact with a Power Cube box in Showdown. Use this to your advantage in keeping enemies away from the box with the coins from when your pouch splits. This strategy works particularly well in Rockwall Brawl in 8 out of the 10 spawn points. This also helps Penny open multiple grouped up boxes at ease.
    Penny's cannon has extremely long range and is able to hit the IKE turret in Siege while being out of range from the IKE's blasts if placed perfectly in the corner of all Siege maps. This strategy can work even better if there is a bush to hide the cannon, allowing the cannon to potentially deal more damage due to it being harder to notice. However, place the turret discreetly as enemies can defeat the turret quickly if they notice it.
        It is also possible to throw the cannon inside the opponent IKE's range and let 4 cannonballs onto the IKE turret if Last Blast is equipped. This will deal about 20-25% damage of the IKE's health. Even more damage can be dealt if Penny manages to place her turret very close to the IKE and activates her Pocket Detonator Gadget, and couple it with her Last Blast Star Power.
    Last Blast causes her cannon to launch several cannonballs upon its destruction, dealing major splash damage. This can discourage short-ranged Brawlers from destroying her cannon. Additionally, it allows Penny to attempt a different playstyle in which she places the cannon in the middle of a fight, and if her Last Blast is equipped, even when destroyed it will bombard the enemy team, even behind cover.
    Balls of Fire is very effective at restricting where an enemy is willing to go, often cutting off their escape route. This is valuable in game modes focused on control, such as Gem Grab and Siege. The additional damage it deals is also effective against stationary targets such as safes and IKE turrets.
    When facing a Penny with her turret, don't backtrack because the cannon will hit which deals more damage than that of her main attack. To avoid this, keep on moving and don't stop.
    Penny's Pocket Detonator Gadget can be useful to destroy walls on certain maps, for example, walls in front of the enemy goal in Brawl Ball. Caution is advised when to use that move though. Her Super may be more valuable for control and detonating it instantly might be disadvantageous. Additionally, a team member may rely on specific walls to function properly on a map.
    Penny's Last Blast and Pocket Detonator Gadget are better on modes with stationary targets such as Heist and Siege. However, the amount of control Penny can maintain with Balls of Fire and Captain's Compass makes it the overall better combination. Captain's Compass can also act as a safety net in case an enemy attempts to ambush or assassinate her.
    Penny's Captain's Compass Gadget and Balls of Fire combination are excellent in Hot Zone, because tanks such as Frank are popular in this mode, and Captain's Compass provides easy hits when both players are in the zone, with the fire allowing for more damage and control to defeat the enemy brawler. Using this combination, it is much easier to eliminate your enemies even when you're dead if you fire it right. <br><br><br><br><br>

Rico (formerly Ricochet) is a Super Rare Brawler with low health and moderately high damage output. His attack and Super have unique bullets that can bounce off of walls and keep traveling. When properly utilized, this ability can allow Rico to knock out enemy Brawlers without coming under fire himself. His first Gadget, Multiball Launcher, rapidly blasts waves of bouncy bullets around himself in all directions. His second Gadget, Bouncy Castle, allows his next attack to heal him slightly every time one of its bullets bounces off a wall, healing him significantly if used correctly. His first Star Power, Super Bouncy, causes his bullets do extra damage after bouncing. His second Star Power, Robo Retreat, allows him to move faster when his health falls below 40%.

Attack: Bouncy Bullets
"Rico's bullets bounce off walls, gaining range. They can hit enemies behind cover."

Rico shoots a linear burst of bullets that can bounce off of walls. Each bullet can bounce 3 times, and the bullets gain 1.67 tiles of additional range for every bounce. This attack takes 0.95 seconds to complete.
Super: Trick Shot
"Rico fires a long burst of bullets that pierce through enemies and bounce off walls, gaining range."

When his Super is used it fires a larger, longer-range burst of bouncing bullets which can keep traveling after hitting an enemy and can bounce off walls 3 times for an additional of 1.67 tiles for every bounce. The bullets pierce through enemies, but can only damage an enemy once. This Super takes 1.35 seconds to complete.
Gadgets
Multiball Launcher
"Rico blasts waves of bouncy bullets in all directions."

Rico fires two waves of bullets with a range of 12 tiles in 8 directions around himself that each deal 320 damage. These bullets act identical to his Super's, but last for a shorter period. Each bullet can also hit multiple enemies, but only damage an enemy once.
Bouncy Castle
"Rico's next attack will heal him for 300 health from each bounce of a projectile."

When Rico activates this Gadget, his next attack heals him for 300 health each time a bullet from his attack bounces. This counts for multiple bounces from one bullet, and in total, Rico can, at most, heal for 4500 health from this Gadget. A Gadget symbol will glow above Rico's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after this attack is shot.
Star Powers
Super Bouncy
"Rico's bullets, from attack and Super alike, get supercharged by their first bounce and deal +124 damage!"

If Rico's bullets (from either his main attack or his Super) bounce off a wall, they glow and deal 124 bonus damage. The bonus damage must be added once, or else enemies will take normal damage, and can only be supercharged once. This does not affect Multiball Launcher.
Robo Retreat
"When Rico falls below 40% health, he runs 34% faster!"

When Rico's health falls below 40%, he gains a 34% movement speed boost, allowing him to move much faster and escaping enemies easily. The effect goes away when his health restores above 40%.
Tips

    Rico has fairly low health, so you must utilize the bouncing ability and range of his attack and Super to damage enemies without coming under enemy fire.
    Rico's Super has a much longer range than his regular attack, so it is useful for defeating enemy Brawlers that are escaping or making a shot that requires multiple bounces.
    When shooting off a wall at an enemy moving away, move towards the place you are shooting to increase the range of your bullets so that you may hit more shots. If you cannot see them in bushes, move side-to-side while shooting off the wall to cover the most area with your bullets.
    Because Rico can bounce his shots off walls giving his total range 1.67 tiles more for every bounce, he is extremely good on maps with a lot of walls, like Cavern Churn. Always try bouncing shots off walls.
    When Rico's Super attack is fully charged try to use it on enemies who are more or less surrounded by walls so you can get the maximum damage out of it.
    When being chased by a short-range opponent, Rico can easily "snipe" them while running away, especially when utilizing the Robo Retreat Star Power. This strategy can be used on short range heavyweights such as El Primo and Bull.
    Though difficult to do, Rico can charge up back-to-back Supers if every bullet from his Super successfully hits an enemy Brawler. This is easier if several enemies are hit during a single Super. Colt, despite having a very similar Super to Rico's is unable to do this due to his Super charge rate of 7%.
    Since Rico's Super pierces through enemies, you can use the Super in Heist when the enemies are lined up to hit both them and the safe.
    Rico's Super Bouncy Star Power gives his bouncy bullets an additional 124+ damage upon bouncing. While it does not seem like much for each bullet, when all six bullets are bounced an additional 620 damage is added, making his total damage 2860. Similarly, a bounced Super will have a total damage of 6864. This encourages Rico to bounce attack and Super shots off walls for them to do more damage (especially in Heist maps like Snaked Assault and Turnaround) where he has potential to bounce his shots from a safe distance. Avoid the common mistake of shooting the Super on the Safe and expecting it to deal damage to it again when it bounces back, as the Super only deals damage once, and if you want to make use of Super Bouncy you'll have to bounce it off a wall without hitting the Safe in such a way that the bounced shots hit it.
    Rico's Robo Retreat Star Power allows you to go into fights, then escape when you are on low health. Doing this will allow more of your bullets to hit Brawlers due to the increased accuracy. If you are a good sniper, you should back away from fights and attack from a distance. For more experienced players/good dodgers, you can keep firing to prevent Rico from healing and stay below 40% health to abuse the speed buff to dodge attacks and even outrun speedy Brawlers like Mortis and Crow. This is also incredibly useful in Boss Fight and Super City Rampage when waiting for teammates to respawn, to outrun the Boss Robot and its attacks.
    Rico is a great pick for special events, with his Robo Retreat Star Power. In Robo Rumble, Boss Fight, and Super City Rampage, he can provide continuous damage to the robots in each event with his very fast reload speed and moderately high damage, while staying out of danger if he's able to bounce his shots in such a way he doesn't have to come within range of the robot(s) to hit them. His piercing Super is useful to hit the mini robots in Robo Rumble and Boss Fight, and its very high damage allows him to significantly damage the big robots in all the three events. The bounce effect of his Super allows him to attack safely, similar to his attack.
    If Rico has just respawned, he can go very close to the Boss in the above events in such a way his hitbox is inside the hitbox of the boss and activate his gadget to deal epic damage to the Boss, when all bullets hit. This is due to the large hitbox of the Boss in each event, and therefore works on the Safe in Heist too. However, don’t do this without the respawning invulnerability shield as the Boss has powerful melee attacks. <br><br><br><br><br>

Bea is an Epic Brawler with low health but a high damage potential. Her attack is a long-ranged bee that deals moderately low damage. Hitting an enemy with this shot supercharges her next shot to deal very high damage. Bea only has 1 ammo slot that reloads fast but has a long cooldown for each shot. Her Super shoots 7 drones that slightly damage enemies and slow them down. Her first Gadget, Honey Molasses, deploys a beehive that creates sticky honey around itself, slowing down enemies who step inside. Her second Gadget, Rattled Hive, sends 4 bees spiralling outwards from her that damage enemies depending on their travel distance. Her first Star Power, Insta Beaload, gives her a second chance to have a supercharged shot if she misses her supercharged shot once. Her second Star Power, Honeycomb, gives her a shield whenever she has a supercharged shot ready.

Attack: Big Sting
"Bea sends out a long range shot that, upon landing, supercharges her next shot to deal epic damage!"

Bea launches a long-ranged bee that deals moderately low damage. If the shot hits an enemy, her next attack becomes supercharged and does 175% more damage, along with a yellow ammo bar. She only supercharges her attack when hitting a Brawler or an appropriate entity in Boss Fight, Robo Rumble, or Super City Rampage. Bea has only one ammo slot, so kicking the ball in Brawl Ball doesn’t consume any ammo. If Bea is defeated with a supercharged shot, the supercharge effect is lost and must be regained.

She can’t have two consecutive supercharged attacks.
Super: Iron Hive
"Bea deploys a swarm of drones that move and turn like jets. They slow down any opponents caught in their path."

Bea releases 7 drones that spread out as they travel after 2.67 tiles. They deal minor damage each to enemies they hit and slow them down for 3 seconds.
Gadgets
Honey Molasses
"Bea drops a beehive with a splash of sticky honey around it. The honey slows down enemies that step in it."

Upon activation, Bea deploys a beehive at her position that creates a large yellow honey puddle around itself. This puddle spreads past walls and slows down enemies' movement in its 4 tile radius. The beehive has 1000 health and will be destroyed if Bea uses her Gadget again.
Rattled Hive
"Bea unleashes 4 angry bees that circle away from her, dealing more damage the further they go (up to 600 damage)."

When activated, 4 bees will circle around Bea that spiral away from her. Each bee deals 295 damage initially and 600 damage if they’re far enough for a total of 2400 damage if all of them hit an enemy. The bees can fly over walls and cover up to 10 tiles horizontally and vertically before despawning. However, the bees can’t pierce multiple enemies and they disappear after hitting a target. If Bea is defeated, stunned, pulled-in, or knocked back before all bees are unleashed, the Gadget gets interrupted.
Star Powers
Insta Beaload
"Instantly supercharge Bea's Big Sting one time if she misses a supercharged shot."

Bea can regain her supercharged shot if she misses it, giving her a second chance to use the supercharged shot. However, she won’t get a third chance if she misses it again.
Honey Comb
"Bea receives a 20% shield while Big Sting is supercharged."

When Bea's Big Sting attack is supercharged, she gains a shield that reduces all damage received by 20%. This effect is lost the moment she fires the shot.
Tips

    If you're not sure whether a Bea has a supercharged shot or not, you can check the bee flying close to her. If it's glowing red (for enemies) or blue (for you/allies), that shows a supercharged shot is ready.
    Bea has only one ammo slot and low health, so she can be ambushed easily. It is advised not to stay too close to bushes that cover a large area like in Cavern Churn, because close-ranged Brawlers and assassins such as Shelly, Bull, Darryl, Edgar, or Crow can be great counters and can inflict lots of burst damage if they have been bush-camping or behind walls nearby, and assassins can dodge your shots easily with their fast movement speed and/or fast Supers (i.e. Stu).
    Since Bea's Super can slow down enemies, she can use it to escape from enemies who are chasing her. She can also use it to slow down enemies who are trying to escape from her.
    Since Bea's Super spreads out, it is great for checking bushes when you know an enemy brawler is hiding, but the area the bush covers is too large for her normal attack.
    Note that Bea's shot will only supercharge her next shot if it hits an enemy Brawler or Bosses in certain events; hitting anything else, such as Showdown crates, the Heist safe, the Siege IKE turret, and minions such as Scrappy and Nita's bear will not supercharge her next shot.
    Take into consideration that while it is easy to charge Bea's Super (3 shots only), her normal shot and supercharged shot have the same Super charge (1/3).
    Usually, most Brawlers are fast enough to be able to dodge Bea's shots. However, upon hitting a Brawler with her Super, it is possible to auto-aim them down very quickly without aiming manually, as the Brawler is slowed down and unable to move fast enough to dodge her shots. Keep in mind that Brawlers with movement speed boosts from Star Powers or Supers might still be abled to dodge auto-aimed shots.
    It is advisable to place Bea's first Gadget behind a wall in order to make it harder for enemies to destroy the beehive, as it only has 1000 health (this will not be the case if a thrower is among the enemies, because they will be able to shoot over the wall). Alternatively, Bea can use it as a shield to tank some damage if she finds herself in a desperate situation where they need to escape quickly with their remaining health.
    Bea's second Gadget, Rattled Hive, is very unpredictable and hard to dodge if players are dealing with other threats. Because the bees move faster and do more damage at a longer range, it is more advisable to use this Gadget offensively for massive area denial and damage potential than to use it defensively. It can also be used to check bushes that are behind walls and damage throwers hiding behind walls. <br><br><br><br><br>

Bibi is an Epic Brawler who has moderate-high health, a high damage output, and a fast movement speed. Bibi attacks by swinging her baseball bat in a wide and close-ranged arc. She charges her Home Run bar by having all 3 ammo, and charging it makes her next attack knock enemies back. Bibi's Super sends out a long-ranged bubble that can pierce through enemies and bounce off of walls. Her Gadget, Vitamin Booster, heals her over time. Her first Star Power, Home Run, increases her movement speed when her Home Run bar is charged. Her second Star Power, Batting Stance, grants her a shield when her Home Run Bar is charged.
Attack: Three Strikes
"Bibi swings her baseball bat. When she has three swings at the ready, her Home Run bar will charge. Once fully charged, her next swing will knock back enemies!"

Bibi swings with her baseball bat, hitting enemies in a wide, 150 degree arc. The attack, much like Frank's, takes time to wind up, but unlike Frank, she isn’t immobile while attacking and there isn’t any travel time, so the attack instantly takes effect after the delay. In addition, if Bibi's ammo bars are full, her Home Run bar begins to charge. Her Home Run bar takes 2 seconds to charge up, and when fully charged, it causes Bibi's next attack to knock enemies back. However, its damage output remains the same. This attack takes 1.3 seconds to complete.

Super: Spitball
"Bibi bats a bouncing ball of bubble gum that can go through enemies, and even hit the same target multiple times!"

Bibi sends out a large, long-ranged bubble. This bubble is able to pierce through enemies and bounce off of walls. However, the bubble pops and disappear after 5 seconds. Using her Super again while the previous one is active won’t cancel either bubble.
Gadget: Vitamin Booster
"Bibi heals 600 health per second for 4.0 seconds."

By using this Gadget, Bibi heals 2400 health over 4 seconds, or 600 health per second. This Gadget can’t be used if Bibi is at full health.
Star Powers
Home Run
"Bibi's movement speed is increased by 12% when her Home Run bar is fully charged."

When Bibi's Home Run bar is full, her movement speed is increased from 820 points to 920 points. However, Bibi moves normally again after using her Home Run swing.
Batting Stance
"When Bibi's Homerun bar is fully charged, she shields herself from all damage by 20%."

When Bibi's Home Run Bar is full, she gains a shield that reduces all damage she takes by 20%. This shield disappears after you use her Home Run Swing.
Tips

    Bibi's ability to knock enemies back when her Home Run bar is charged can be used to avoid contact from short-ranged Brawlers, which allows you to escape, and to stop dangerous Supers before they fully execute, like those of Frank and Carl.
    When fighting another Bibi, you can start your attack before you get in range, and because Bibi's attack takes time to take effect, you can knockback or hit the opposing Bibi before their swing goes off. You can see that the enemy Bibi's Brawler model leans a little as the enemy starts to attack, which you can use to help time your attack or to retreat. This same mechanic of knocking the enemy back before you get in range can be applied when fighting other Brawlers. It takes a bit of practice to learn the correct timing, but using this trick greatly increases your skill and ability with Bibi.
    Knocking enemies back can also be a disadvantage if she pushes them away from enemy fire, especially for medium to long-ranged Brawlers who can still hit her from that greater distance, and it’s especially dangerous to you for certain Brawlers that deal more damage in mid-long range such as Emz. It is useful to work out in advance if using the knockback is beneficial in a certain situation, and to either discard the knockback by attacking the air, or conserving ammo and storing the knock back ability. You can deliberately discard your knockback from a charged Home Run bar by swinging Bibi's bat prematurely, if your next move is to only attack enemies which you don't want to knockback. In order to avoid helping a target escape from her Home Run’s knockback, Bibi can knock them into a nearby wall and then go up to them and defeat them.
    Using her Super directly after starting the swing to knock an enemy back can result in the bubble hitting them twice, usually securing a defeat against low-medium health Brawlers.
    Bibi's knockback, just like Gale’s Super, can be used to push enemies away from vital areas or items or away from teammates attempting to reach an objective. For example, she can knock defending enemies away from the safe in Heist, the Siege Bot in Siege or the goal in Brawl Ball to free up space for teammates to attack the safe/IKE or to prevent/score a goal, or allow a Siege Bot to get to the enemy IKE in the respective events. She can also use this to knock enemies out of a zone in Hot Zone and away from Gems in Gem Grab, the Ball in Brawl Ball, your safe in Heist, the blue Star in Bounty, and your IKE and Bolts in Siege.
    You can increase the effectiveness of her Home Run's knockback mechanic in Events with Modifiers active. For instance, Bibi can push targets towards the destination of Meteors or away from Healing Mushrooms and Energy Drinks.
        In maps with the Energy Drink Modifier, Bibi can hide in a bush near an energy drink. When an enemy approaches it, get out of the bush and knock the enemy back, collecting the Energy Drink in the process. Unless the enemy in question has a large amount of Power Cubes, Bibi can finish off the enemy with the damage boost.
    If aimed correctly, Bibi's Super can repeatedly bounce off walls to deal a lot of damage to a safe in walled maps such as Turnaround. Her Super is also able to bounce off of the other wall edge and hit an IKE turret twice in Siege without being out of the IKE’s range. Her Super is also useful to defeat low-health Brawlers.
    In Brawl Ball, Bibi can knock the Ball out of an enemy’s grasp, allowing her to steal the Ball or prevent enemies from scoring a goal. This makes her an excellent goalkeeper of some sort because she can protect the goal as well as grab the Ball and kick it away with her fast movement speed and fast reload speed. In addition, both of her Star Powers are useful in Brawl Ball. Her Home Run Star Power allows Bibi to reach the Ball or reach the enemy team's goal much faster when her Home Run Bar is full. Her Batting Stance Star Power allows her to take less damage, which is useful when enemies are attempting to steal the Ball from her or when she needs to walk the Ball into the enemy goal.
    Bibi's widely-spread attack, very fast reload speed, and high damage output are useful in Showdown maps with a lot of Power Cube boxes grouped together like Acid Lakes/Two Thousand Lakes and Feast or Famine. However, exercise caution in Feast or Famine as there are dense bushes surrounding the box, and you’ll never know how many Brawlers are in the bush. You could easily be ambushed and defeated if the enemy is a good counter to Bibi such as Bull, even more so as Bibi can’t escape using her Home Run’s knockback after using up attacks on the boxes. <br><br><br><br><br>

Edgar is an Epic Brawler who could be unlocked for free as a Brawlidays 2020 gift from December 19th through January 7th or from Brawl Boxes. He has moderate damage, a very fast movement speed, but low health. His Trait makes his Super charge itself over time. His attacks throw two quick short-ranged scarf punches with an extremely fast cooldown and reload speed. He also simultaneously and slightly heals when he attacks an enemy Brawler. His Super is a quick jump over obstacles with a speed boost upon landing. His Gadget, Let's Fly, drastically increases his Trait’s Super-charge for a period of time. His first Star Power, Hard Landing, allows his Super to deal moderate damage to enemies in his Super's landing area-of-effect. His second Star Power, Fisticuffs, increases the amount he heals per punch.

Trait
"This Brawler charges Super over time."

Edgar's Super charges automatically over time, similarly to Darryl. It takes 30 seconds to fully charge his Super normally while not attacking.
Attack: Fight Club
"Hits enemies with quick punches from his scarf, healing himself for each landed punch."

Edgar throws out two short-ranged piercing punches from his scarf, healing himself for 25% of the damage dealt per punch. The attack cooldown is extremely short, and the attack takes 0.35 seconds to complete. The amount healed scales with Power Cubes or other outside buffs such as Colonel Ruffs' or 8-BIT's Super.
Super: Vault
"Edgar jumps over any obstacle and gets a temporary speed boost. His Super will slowly charge over time."

Edgar jumps into the air and over obstacles briefly before landing onto the area where the Super was aimed, and when auto-aimed, he will jump to the nearest enemy. If there are lakes, his jump range is extended to the nearest ground. While in the air, Edgar is completely immune to all damage besides status effects and damage applied over time. On landing, he boosts his movement speed by 200 points for 2.5 seconds.
Gadget: Let's Fly
"Edgar's Super charges faster, 525% for 4 seconds."

Edgar's Trait’s Super-charge speed is 525% faster for 4 seconds. This increases the auto-charge speed per second from 3.333% to 17.5%, or 70% of his Super over the Gadget's duration.
Star Powers
Hard Landing
"Edgar's Super will also deal 1000 damage to nearby enemies upon landing."

When landing from his Super, Edgar deals 1000 damage in a 3 tile radius around him. In addition, an altered landing indicator shows the area-of-effect.
Fisticuffs
"Edgar receives 25% more healing from the damage he deals."

Edgar receives 25% more healing per punch. This increases his healing rate per punch from his base 25% to 31.25%, and excluding outside buffs, increases it from 189 to 236.
Tips

    Although he’s able to counter high-health Brawlers with slow unload speeds such as Pam and Frank, Edgar doesn’t have the health to easily outmatch heavyweights. Because of that, it’s better to focus on weaker targets such as throwers and sharpshooters, or fighters and support Brawlers with low health or mediocre damage at close range such as Emz.
        However, his Fisticuffs Star Power greatly helps to take on heavyweights. Still, take caution when approaching them.
    Edgar is an incredibly great ambusher and camper in Showdown, Knockout, and Duo Showdown, and Lone Star. Though he has low health, he has high burst damage, and he regains some health every time he lands a successful punch, and coupled with the fact that his reload and unload speed is extremely fast, this makes him a menace. When playing Edgar, use him in maps with a plethora of walls such as Cavern Churn, in which these are what he dominates in. In Duo Showdown, just like other short-range Brawlers such as El Primo, he can be paired up with strong healers like Poco and Pam to increase the chances of victory.
    Edgar is an outstanding choice in Brawl Ball, Volley Brawl, Basket Brawl, and Trophy Thieves because of his fast movement speed and abilities. He can kick the respective ball/trophy ahead of him and then use his Super to jump to and grab the respective item again (self-passing), similar to El Primo, Darryl, Bull, Crow, Stu, and Mortis. After self-passing, he can then quickly shoot the respective item in the designated area. Edgar is also aided by the speed boost that he gains after his Super. Keep in mind that Edgar has low health, so be careful while performing this.
    His speed boost after his Super can also be utilized well in Gem Grab or Siege as he can jump onto the Gem mine or into the Bolt spawns, which then he can steal Gems or Bolts and quickly retreat. He can also use this to escape more effectively when he’s in danger.
    Lou and Byron have a great synergy with Edgar, especially in Duo Showdown. Lou can stun the enemies with his attack (or Super with Lou's Star Power Supercool) and slow enemies with his Super, allowing Edgar to jump onto the affected enemies and quickly eliminate them. Meanwhile, Byron can continuously heal Edgar while Edgar plays aggressively and ambushes enemies.
    With his Let's Fly Gadget, Edgar can quickly charge his Super to make a quick getaway or to ambush a low-health target. He can also quickly charge his Super to jump towards or onto a zone in Hot Zone and get some quick capturing. Another way to utilize it is to get a quick defeat in Knockout.
    In Siege, Edgar can utilize his Super and his Super’s speed boost to steal Bolts quickly, giving you a Siege Bot easily. Similar to El Primo, he can also jump past the enemy IKE walls in Siege, and with his Hard Landing Star Power and his extremely fast reload and unload speed in his attack, this can allow him to deal high damage to the enemy IKE, though it’s better to damage the IKE behind and with a Siege Bot. He can also use these techniques in Heist, but more effectively, and start rapidly damaging the safe with his punches along with his Hard Landing Star Power.
    Edgar has the shortest attack range in the game, so you must maintain close range with your enemies. If you don’t have your Super, you can utilize cover and obstacles to steadily advance to enemies. If you do have your Super charged up, use it to jump directly on (ambushing) an enemy. You may also bush-camp and wait for an enemy to walk near the bush, and then quickly get out of the bush and attack them.
    When facing heavyweights (except for Frank) or high-health Brawlers with high burst damage such as Shelly, Bull, or Jacky, who might be able to 2-shot or 3-shot Edgar's low health, make sure to use cover, Power Cubes, or your Super to your advantage and attempt to dodge their attacks.
    If fighting against Frank, it is recommended to attack and use Edgar's speed to your advantage. Each time Frank attacks, there’s a delay, where Edgar can move behind Frank and deal damage while taking none, and healing if needed. You may also use your Super to jump over his devastating Super, therefore leaving it to waste. Attacking works better with his Fisticuffs Star Power because of the boosted healing.
    Brawlers with slow attack unload speeds like Pam and 8-BIT can be defeated by Edgar at close-quarters combat despite their high health since Edgar can unload all his attacks extremely quickly, also healing himself in the process. Due to their slow unload and Edgar's speed after a Super, Edgar can strafe away from the majority of the fire. However, note that if Edgar incorrectly strafes, he might take the full damage of the attack which might deal high damage to him, even defeating him. If you can, bush-camping is almost always a better option. Still, make sure to analyze all of your options and the enemy's before committing a jump on them.
    In Boss Fight, Edgar can utilize his mechanics to provide nearly-unparalleled offense/defense. It is recommended for him to be the Power Cube carrier. With his Hard Landing Star Power, he can dish out 1000 additional damage to bot swarms; with Fisticuffs, he can dive into swarms of bots, and heal extremely effectively, but this is only effective when he has at least 20 or more Power Cubes (depending on the difficulty).
        Additional buffs will also benefit Edgar; 8-BIT, Colonel Ruffs, Pam, and Max all make Edgar more menacing in Boss Fight.
    Though with low health and short range, Edgar still does decent in other Boss Events such as Big Game, Robo Rumble, and Super City Rampage, and Takedown, and he does better in these events with his Fisticuffs Star Power. He can stall the Bosses or robots long enough to deal lots of damage. Though, take caution while using Edgar, such as in Big Game as the Big Boss, make sure to use your speed to your advantage to evade the Hunter’s shots and even though this is less effective as a Big Boss, you can use your healing and Fisticuffs to stay in the game longer. In Takedown, try to ignore player conflict if possible and focus on collecting Power Cubes and attacking the Boss.
    Edgar is mediocre in Bounty since long-ranged Brawlers dominate the mode. To play him in Bounty, focus on pressuring enemies in the back of the map, and do a hit-and-run attack using your Super. However, don’t play him in open maps like Purple Paradise as he’s more vulnerable to longer-ranged Brawlers. <br><br><br><br><br>

Frank is an Epic Brawler who has the highest health of any Brawler and a high damage output, but loses mobility while attacking or using his Super. His Trait allows Frank to charge his Super from enemies damaging him. His attack is a delayed swing of his hammer on the ground that sends a shockwave. His Super, similar to his attack, is a larger shockwave that destroys obstacles and stuns enemies it hits at the expense of a longer delay. His first Gadget, Active Noise Canceling, allows him to temporarily become immune to stuns, slows and knockbacks. His second Gadget, Irresistible Attraction, makes his next attack pull hit enemies towards him. His first Star Power, Power Grab, momentarily increases his damage output after he defeats an enemy Brawler. His second Star Power, Sponge, increases his maximum health for the duration of the match.

Trait
"This Brawler charges Super from damage received."

Whenever Frank takes damage from an enemy Brawler, he charges his Super. The Super charge rate depends on the damage the enemy deals. It takes 20000 damage to charge a Super completely, and all damage is calculated after shielding and other such effects.
Attack: Hammer Hit
"Frank takes a while to wind up his hammer blow, but the hit is so hard it sends a shockwave."

Frank swings his hammer on the ground, sending a shockwave that pierces multiple enemies. His attack has a large delay due to his very slow unload speed at 1.3 seconds, but has a very fast reload speed. Frank is also immobile while attacking, and if hit with a stun, pull, or knockback during the large delay, his attack is cancelled.
Super: Stunning Blow
"Frank's greatest hit sends a shockwave that destroys environment and stuns enemies for a while."

Frank swings his hammer on the ground, sending a larger shockwave that destroys obstacles and stuns enemies for 2 seconds, rendering them completely vulnerable to fire, but his Super has a larger delay than his attack. Just like his attack, Frank is immobile while performing his Super, and if hit with a stun, pull, or knockback during the large delay, his Super is cancelled.
Gadgets
Active Noise Canceling
"Frank clears any disabling effect on himself, and momentarily becomes immune to stuns, slows and knockbacks."

Upon activation, Frank becomes immune to stuns, slows, and knockbacks for 1.5 seconds, excluding El Primo‘s Suplex Supplement Gadget and Sprout’s Super knockback. This Gadget can be used while he's attacking or using his Super.
Irresistible Attraction
"Frank's next attack also pulls opponents towards him."

Upon activation, Frank's next attack pulls any enemies it hits towards him. This cancels any attacks and Supers, such as an opposing Frank's Super. A Gadget symbol will glow above Frank's head signaling this Gadget's activation, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cool-down begins after the attack is used.
Star Powers
Power Grab
"Frank steals the power of a Brawler he defeats, increasing his damage by 50% for 12 seconds!"

After defeating an enemy Brawler, Frank glows purple and his damage is increased by 50% for 12 seconds for a total of 2604 damage while it’s active and if there aren’t any outside damage buffs or debuffs. If he defeats another enemy while it’s active, the effect doesn’t stack, but the duration is refreshed.
Sponge
"Frank gains +1100 health."

Frank gains 1100 additional health for the duration of the match, increasing his maximum health to 10900. This also affects the self-healing process and Colette's attack damage.
Tips

    Frank has a reasonably high damage output, but a slow unload speed and immobility, meaning Frank can’t effectively chase down enemies. Because of this, you also shouldn’t attack an enemy if you’re in danger of dying and running away from them. To deal damage to an enemy without making yourself vulnerable, try to ambush them one on one from the bushes, so they won’t have much time to react.
    Frank’s range is relatively short, but if you’re chasing a long-ranged Brawler or playing him on an open map where long-ranged Brawlers are popular such as Purple Paradise in Bounty, don’t attack until your range is within the enemy and use Frank’s above-average movement speed to dodge the enemy’s shots. You should also use his Sponge Star Power if playing him on an open map, because it enables him to get to enemies without dying easily. Even so, he is most viable in maps or events with a plethora of obstacles to fight and ambush enemies in close quarters such as Cavern Churn in Showdown, Brawl Ball, and Hot Zone.
    In Brawl Ball, Frank can charge his Super easily at the beginning of a round due to how close each Brawler spawns near each other, and then break the goalpost and other goal obstacles to make scoring much easier. For the same reason, since his Super charges up easily (3 hits), he can Super the Ball into the goal easily. These abilities along with his very high health (allowing him to survive longer), his Trait, his above-average movement speed and his Active Noise Cancelling Gadget make him very viable in this event and make him an ideal Ball carrier.
    In Siege, Frank is useful because he can stun the enemy team and prevent them from obtaining Bolts. He can also stun the enemy IKE and allow his team and the Siege Bot to attack it safely but temporarily. He can also stun the enemy Siege Bot and hinder it from attacking the team IKE. With his Trait, he can easily charge his Super from enemies and carry out the above strategies. His high health and fast movement speed make him ideal for obtaining Bolts, or a tank for lower-health teammates to get control of the Bolt spawns.
    Frank is also useful in Gem Grab, because stunning the enemy team is also effective, allowing for control of the Gem mine and allows his allies to collect Gems at ease. He can also stun the enemy Gem carrier and easily defeat the enemy if they’re escaping while holding Gems. He’s also decent as the Gem carrier, because he can hold Gems easily with his high health, and he can use his Super to stun enemies who are chasing him (in which damaging Frank is detrimental to the enemies because of his Trait, in which Frank can charge his Super quicker and stun them), therefore preventing them from defeating him.
    Frank is niche in Hot Zone, because he can stay in the zones longer and control the zones thanks to his enormous health pool and his high damage output. With his relatively fast Super charge rate (3 hits) and his Trait, he can stun the enemies and render them completely vulnerable to fire as they can’t hold their ground in the zones and can be defeated easily.
    When your Super and your attacks are charged, use your Super to stun enemies first, and hold them still while you eliminate them with your attacks, and because they’re stunned, they can’t provide counter fire. If used correctly, it can allow you and your team to wipe out the enemy/enemy team.
    Frank is effective against longer-ranged Brawlers if he dodges their shots, but is extremely effective against tanks and other-close-ranged Brawlers such as El Primo and Rosa, because he deals high damage to the close-ranged Brawlers because they need to maintain point-blank range of him in order to damage him.
    A great composition when playing Duo Showdown or Brawl Ball is Frank with Tara. Once both of you have your Supers charged, then this strategy works. First, look for a group of enemy players. Tara should pull in all the enemies in range, while Frank stuns them, hindering them greatly.
    If possible, use Frank’s Active Noise Canceling Gadget before performing his Super to prevent enemies from cancelling it with their disruptive abilities. Additionally, you can also use your Trait to hinder disruptive abilities. Allow your enemy to charge both yours and the enemy’s Supers, then allow the enemy to use their disruptive Super, then use your Super on the enemy and defeat them with your attacks, while the enemy can’t provide counter fire or cancel your Super with their attack after wasting their Super (except for Lou and Bibi). You should especially use these strategies on Shelly, because her ability to chain her Super could greatly hinder Frank.
    Frank does moderately good in Big Game as a Hunter because he can still deal high damage even though his Super’s stun is ineffective against the Big Boss. However, when he is the Big Boss, Frank dominates, because he can deal massive damage to enemies, which is better justified with his Power Grab Star Power, and he can use his Super to stun enemies, therefore preventing them from defeating him.
    Frank's Irresistible Attraction Gadget can be used right after his Super to pull the enemies towards him so he can finish them off. If timed correctly, he can also use it to either pull enemy defenders away from the ball or to free up some space to score a goal more easily in Brawl Ball.
    Since he has the highest amount of health of any Brawler, he and Colonel Ruffs work well together, as Colonel Ruff’s Field Promotion Star Power and Super boosts Frank’s health and damage output drastically. However, be aware of Colette since she can deal incredible amounts of damage to Frank due to his boosted health.
    Frank is also ideal in Hold the Trophy. His fast movement speed allows him to catch up to the trophy easily, and the slowing effect from the trophy won’t affect him much. Due to Frank’s extremely high health, he can easily hold the trophy and can withstand countless attacks from enemies. As a defender of the trophy holder, he’ll ruthlessly deal high damage to enemies, and he can stun the enemies, hindering them from receiving the trophy or defeating the team’s trophy holder.
    Frank is also viable in Takedown. With his fast movement speed, he can pick up Power Cubes and catch up to the Boss easily and can deal massive damage to the Boss and continuously with his fast reload speed, and he can withstand countless attacks from the Boss with his already high health and the boosted health from the Power Cubes.
    Frank is useful for Robo Rumble because he has high health, and he can out-damage and defeat the melee and mini robots while his teammates defeat the sniper robots. He can use his Super to stun the big robot and he can use his Irresistible Attraction Gadget to pull the big robot away from the safe, therefore hindering the big robot. Frank also doesn’t need to stress about ammo consumption because of his incredibly fast reload speed, so he can consistently defend. His Super should be used carefully late-game, however, because it destroys obstacles and leaves the safe open for robots to attack it.
    If possible, charge up your Super and use it to stun an enemy who’s taking cover behind an obstacle. The Super deals sufficient damage while stunning the enemy, and it also destroys the obstacle, rendering it completely useless to the enemies in the future. <br><br><br><br><br>

Griff is an Epic Brawler who has moderate health and consistent area damage. Griff attacks by firing three waves of three coins that spread in a cone. His Super throws banknotes that travel forward and return to him, spread in a cone, and deal more damage the further they travel. His Gadget, Piggy Bank, drops a piggy bank that explodes after a delay, dealing area damage to enemies and knocking them back while also destroying obstacles. His Star Power, Keep the Change, allows him to unload his attack faster.

Attack: Coin Toss
"Angry Griff pelts opponents with coins. He throws three salvos that spread out in a cone."

Griff shoots out three waves of three coins in a cone formation. He has an average reload speed, but his attack's unload speed is slow, taking 1.05 seconds to complete.
Super: Cashback
"Griff throws a bunch of sharp-edged banknotes in a wide cone. Too valuable to just give away, they return to him, and may cause paper cuts twice to the same target. Opponents further away take more damage."

Griff throws out 5 banknotes that travel forward, spin for 2 seconds, and return to him afterwards, dealing damage when traveling and returning. The banknotes are interrupted by obstacles when thrown, but can go through obstacles when returning, similarly to Carl's attack. The cards pierce all enemies, spread in a cone, and deal more damage the further they travel.
Gadget: Piggy Bank
"Griff drops a firecracker-filled piggy bank that, after a short delay, explodes destroying obstacles and dealing 1000 damage to opponents within range."

Griff drops a piggy bank that explodes after a 2.5-second delay, dealing 1000 damage to enemies and knocking them back while also destroying all obstacles in a 2.67 tile radius.
Star Power: Keep the Change
"Furious Griff tosses coins faster, reducing the time for a full salvo by 35%."

Griff reduces the time for a full attack by 35%, reducing the attack's unload speed from 1.05 seconds to 0.68 seconds.
Tips

    Although Griff can hit more banknotes with his Super up close, the loss of damage also results in less Super charge. Prioritize his Super on further enemies to charge your Super faster.
    The slow speed of the coins makes it difficult for Griff to compete with long-ranged Brawlers due to the inability to easily control the coins. He instead should be treated as a medium-ranged Brawler with close-ranged burst damage, so prioritize maintaining close-quarters to attack enemies with ease, with the exception of close-ranged Brawlers, and for those Brawlers, you should keep your distance from them.
    Griff's Keep the Change Star Power offers him more protection against heavyweights, but he’ll still struggle against keeping up with the likes of close-ranged assassins such as Mortis, Leon, and Edgar. In this case, Griff should save his Super for instant burst damage when they rush in.
    Griff's Super can make enemies avoid the area where his Super traveled, especially if they’re low-health Brawlers. You can use this to maintain area control, like with controlling the zones in Hot Zone or the Bolt spawns in Siege.
    If you want to finish off enemies who are taking cover behind obstacles, you can use your Piggy Bank Gadget to destroy those obstacles and then use your high-damaging attack to finish them off. <br><br><br><br><br>

Nani is an Epic Brawler who has low health but can deal heavy damage and from a long range. She attacks by firing three light orbs in a diamond formation. Her Super summons a flying drone named Peep which Nani can manually steer into enemies and explodes upon contact, dealing high damage with a knockback to enemies and destroying obstacles in a short radius. Her first Gadget, Warp Blast, teleports to Peep's current location during her Super. Her second Gadget, Return to Sender, partially protects Nani from a single projectile that is converted into a counterattack. Her first Star Power, Autofocus, adds extra damage to her Super the further it travels. Her second Star Power, Tempered Steel, grants Nani a damage-reducing shield whenever Peep is active.

Attack: Trigger-Nometry
"Nani shoots 3 light orbs that move at different angles and converge towards aimed targets."

When Nani attacks, she fires 3 small light orbs, one which travels in a straight line and two side projectiles that split up from the center. The projectiles converge again at the end of her range, forming a diamond-shaped path and dealing extreme amounts of damage if all orbs hit a single enemy. She can control the distance the orbs will travel before colliding with each other by dragging the attack joystick further out. If any orb doesn’t hit a target at the end of their range, they continue on their path for an additional 3 tiles, effectively increasing Nani's attack range. Nani has an attack cooldown of 0.5 seconds.
Super: Manual Override
"Nani takes control of Peep and can steer him remotely into enemies, exploding on contact!"

When Peep is launched, Nani’s movement joystick controls him instead. Nani is immobile while Peep is active. Peep explodes when touching an enemy or a wall and deals massive amounts of damage while destroying any nearby obstacles and knocking back enemies in a small radius. Note that Peep acts as a projectile, not a spawnable, which means Peep is not a target of damaging abilities, and can travel through lakes and rope fences. In addition, Peep explodes after 10 seconds if he doesn’t reach an enemy or wall. Peep gradually accelerates in speed and becomes harder to manoeuvre. If Nani is stunned, defeated, knocked back, or pulled while her Super is active, Peep completely disappears and doesn’t explode.
Gadgets
Warp Blast
"Nani detonates Peep and teleports to his last location."

This Gadget teleports Nani to Peep's current location, destroying Peep in the process. Peep doesn’t deal damage when detonated and instead simply disappears. Nani retains any status effect applied before teleporting.
Return to Sender
"The next time Nani takes damage from an enemy, 80% of the damage is returned to the enemy."

When activated, Nani will gain a special shield around her. The next time she takes damage, she only receives 20% of that number of damage while the rest are deflected back to the enemy in a fast and unavoidable but noticeable projectile. This effect only applies to one projectile (i.e. Nani only converts one shell/bullet from Shelly's Super or Colt's attack). This Gadget calculates the damage absorbed and returned after taking into account Belle's Super.
Star Powers
Autofocus
"Peep deals up to 1600 extra damage based on his travel distance."

The further Peep travels, the more damage Peep will deal when it explodes. Peep does 160 more damage for every second that passes since his activation, for up to 1600 additional damage if he has traveled for 10 seconds, totaling to a 4120 damage maximum.
Tempered Steel
"Nani takes 80% less damage while her Super is active."

Whenever Peep is active, Nani will get a shield that reduces all incoming damage by 80%. Nani loses her shield when Peep is destroyed. This Star Power does not affect Super charge from enemies.
Tips

    Only auto-aim Nani's attack if the enemy is running directly towards you or if the enemy is standing still; otherwise it will most likely miss. Always try to manually aim your main attack when using Nani.
    Pay attention to enemies with canceling capabilities like knockback, pull, and stun. If Nani is moved from Peep's original casting spot, Peep will disappear. Also note that Peep can’t be directly destroyed; however, it can be interrupted by walls, immunity bubbles, pets, etc. When using Nani's Super, wait for the target to either lose their shield or use their pet when going against an enemy with any of these.
    Before using Nani's Super, hide away from any enemies, preferably in bushes, then use her Super. Never use Nani's Super when she's in the middle of a battle, as it leaves Nani vulnerable to enemy attacks. Although this weakness can be alleviated with Nani's Star Power Tempered Steel to shield her, Nani is still vulnerable to being knocked back or stunned which will cause her Super to disappear without exploding.
    Nani's Gadget Warp Blast can be used to reach the enemy safe in Heist, enemy's territory in Trophy Thieves, and the Ball in Brawl Ball more quickly.
    To hit enemies accurately with Nani, try to lead your shots slightly ahead of them, meaning if they're walking away from you, you'd shoot slightly above them.
    Unless within close range of an enemy Brawler, never auto-aim your Super because of the fact that it goes towards the nearest enemy. The direction it will go in may cause you to struggle to control Peep. Try to manually aim your Super so that it starts off in the direction that you want it to go, then control Peep with your movement joystick.
    Because of Nani's unique attack pattern, her shots can be fired at enemies camping behind walls, although normally only 1 of the 3 orbs will hit an enemy. If possible, you can use the unique diamond path of the two outer orbs to hit an enemy behind a wall.
    A good strategy in Duo Showdown, Knockout, and Bounty is to pair up Nani with her Autofocus Star Power with Bo and his Super Totem Gadget. The strategy involves staying in a bush inside Bo’s Gadget’s radius to repeatedly fire Supers and scout for and damage enemies.
    Tempered Steel essentially quintuples her health, allowing her to escape or hide when coupled with Warp Blast, such as in Big Game. Overall, Nani's Super puts her in a very vulnerable position, but the shield provides enough value to deter enemies. Not bursting Nani down completely during its duration allows her to potentially two-shot enemies near her without fear of repercussions.
    You can use Nani's Super as an additional attack when you are in close-quarters with a short-ranged Brawler. This can be very useful as hitting enemies with Peep deals damage and knockbacks, allowing you to escape.
    Tempered Steel is extremely strong in Super City Rampage and Siege as she can take a lot of hits from the Mega Monster or robot, and she can take even more when a Brawler like Pam or Poco is healing her.
    Try not to activate her Return To Sender Gadget when you are near to a Brawler which shoots multiple low damage projectiles, such as Colt, Pam, etc. You will only return a little bit of damage to the enemy Brawler if you use this Gadget against an enemy like this. Only use it when you're going to take one-time high damage, such as Dynamike's Super, another Nani's Super, a Piper bullet or a supercharged Bea shot. This requires some practice and fast reflexes but if utilized well, it can be game-changing. If you can’t properly apply Nani's Return to Sender Gadget in adequate time, you can use it as a temporary 80% shield for one projectile. <br><br><br><br><br>

Pam (formerly Mama J) is an Epic Brawler who has high health and can deal high damage in a large area. Her main attack shoots a burst of scrap metal in a sweeping pattern. Her Super deploys a turret that heals her and allies within its area-of-effect. Her Gadget, Pulse Modulator, triggers her turret to emit a pulse that heals anyone in its area of effect a moderate amount. Her first Star Power, Mama's Hug, allows her to slightly heal herself and allies in range whenever she hits an enemy with her main attack. Her second Star Power, Mama's Squeeze, allows her healing turret to deal damage to enemies within its area of effect.
Attack: Scrapstorm
"Pam sprays a large area with bursts of scrap metal. Safety goggles advised!"

Pam shoots nine pieces of scrap metal in a spread-out volley that sweeps back and forth twice, meaning that she may hit many enemies at once, but it is very inaccurate and inconsistent when dealing with a single enemy, so Pam struggles to defeat Brawlers one-on-one from a distance. However, at close range she can hit all her bullets and deal very high damage. This attack takes 1.05 seconds to complete.

Super: Mama's Kiss
"Pam's healing turret will fix up her and teammates who stay in its area of effect."

Pam's Super deploys a heal station that heals allies within a medium-sized radius similar to 8-BIT's damage booster radius. However, it can’t heal minions like Jessie's turret, Nita's bear, or another Pam's healing station, and it doesn’t stack with other Pam healing turrets.
Gadget: Pulse Modulator
"Pam triggers her turret to emit a pulse that heals allies inside the turret's range, including herself, for 1200 health."

Pam will instantaneously heal any allies and herself in her healing turret's area of effect for 1200 health. She may use it even if she isn’t presently standing in the turret's area of effect. However, Pam has to be within 12 tiles of the turret to activate this Gadget.
Star Powers
Mama's Hug
"Whenever Pam hits enemies with Scrapstorm, she heals herself and nearby friendly Brawlers for 48 health."

Every time Pam hits an enemy with a bullet from her attack, she emits a pulse in a 4 tile radius around her that heals herself and teammates 48 health (432 health in total if all bullets hit). This doesn’t include hits on spawnables such as an enemy Jessie's turret, Nita's bear, an enemy Pam's healing station, Tara's shadow, or Mr. P's robo-porters.
Mama's Squeeze
"Healing turret now also damages enemies for 800 damage per second."

This allows her turret to do 800 damage per second if an enemy Brawler stands within the healing station's healing radius. This includes turrets and other spawnables.
Tips

    Try to get close to enemy Brawlers to deal damage because Pam's main attack is somewhat weak and inaccurate if she’s attacking from a distance. If she doesn’t get close enough, she cannot easily defeat enemy Brawlers without help. However, if all of her bullets hit a single target, she deals an incredible amount of damage and it will most likely leave enemies with very low health.
    Charge Pam's Super as quickly as possible and try to keep a heal station on the field at all times.
    Pam is mainly a defensive Brawler, healing teammates while providing cover fire. However, she can also sweep bushes with her attack, though she should be accompanied by another heavyweight or support Brawler.
    If you are doing a Showdown battle with the Angry Robo Modifier, you can do Duo Showdown with El Primo and Pam. This is the best way to melt the Angry Robo and rack up the power cubes, as they drop 3 when destroyed. Her healing abilities and long range also support El Primo in fights.
    Place Pam's healing turret behind walls/cover, as the healing turret's radius still works through walls. This can ensure plenty of healing while keeping the turret itself safe.
    Pam's Pulse Modulator Gadget is very useful in emergency situations. If you or a teammate is in need of healing, you can give them or yourself an instant heal to stay alive long enough to win an interaction or escape.
    In tight situations, Pam's Super can be quick-fired to serve as an absorbing shield, sacrificing it in the process to increase the chance of escape when being chased, similarly to Colonel Ruff's Take Cover Gadget. However, this should be avoided when you go against Penny's splash damage, Jessie's bounce orbs, or Belle's shots that can still damage Pam when she is behind/around her healing station.
    Pam's Mama's Hug Star Power, while not healing much, can still be a useful aspect in keeping teammates alive. Be sure to stay close to them to maximize healing.
    Her healing turret is especially useful in Siege. When well-placed in the middle of the map, it allows Pam and her teammates to survive and control the middle to gain more bolts. She can also deal damage to enemies in that area using Mama's Squeeze.
    Pam is also very useful in Boss Fight, Robo Rumble and Super City Rampage both for the high damage she can do from a safe range and for her healing turret and Mama's Hug.
    Her Mama's Squeeze Star Power can be used to pressure Brawlers hiding behind walls provided that there no throwers on the other team to take out the turret. This very useful in maps like Encirclement where brawlers spend a lot of time behind a central wall.
    Pam's Mama's Hug Star Power can easily counter tick damage, such as Crow's poison. If you can consistently land your shots, your health will regenerate faster than Crow's poison decay. The same works against Byron.
    Pam can place her healing turret on the Heist safe if she has Mama's Squeeze. This allows her to deal a very high amount of damage in total as the turret will keep dealing damage while it is alive. Coupled with her very fast reload speed and very high damage at close range, she can take out a major portion of the safe's health. Her turret's healing can also protect her other teammates and damage enemies during both offense and defense, making her very good in this mode. <br><br><br><br><br>

Piper is an Epic Brawler who has low health but can deal high damage to faraway targets. She fires a long-ranged bullet from her umbrella that deals more damage the further it travels. Her Super pops grenades at her feet before jumping away from her enemies, dealing damage to enemies upon detonation. Her first Gadget, Auto Aimer, allows her to fire a bullet from a side pistol towards the closest enemy, pushing them back and momentarily slowing them down. Her second Gadget, Homemade Recipe, makes her next bullet home in on enemies. Her first Star Power, Ambush, allows her to deal extra damage while firing from a bush. Her second Star Power, Snappy Sniping, reloads part of her ammo when she hits an enemy.

Attack: Gunbrella
"Piper fires a sniper shot from the tip of her parasol. The shot gains more oompf the farther it flies!"

Piper shoots a single bullet from her parasol that travels very quickly. The farther the bullet travels, the more damage the bullet will inflict, so Piper is less effective against enemies near her, but excels at supporting her team at range. Piper's attack has a very slow reload speed and cooldown of 0.5 seconds.
Super: Poppin'
"Piper hops away to avoid pushy suitors. She leaves them a lady's favor though: live grenades from her garter!"

When her Super is used, Piper will jump up into the air and drop 4 grenades below her that deal heavy damage and knock back enemies near them when they detonate. While in the air, Piper is completely immune to all damage besides status effects and damage applied over time. The grenades take 0.3 seconds to detonate and have a 2 tile explosion radius.
Gadgets
Auto Aimer
"Piper pops a defensive shot at the closest enemy, dealing 100 damage, while also pushing them back and slowing them down."

Piper pulls out a pistol and fires a small thin glowing bullet aimed towards the nearest enemy in a 7 tile radius. The bullet will push the target back and temporarily slow them down for 0.5 seconds if hit. The Gadget can trigger her Snappy Sniping Star Power.
Homemade Recipe
"On activation, Piper's next main attack will home in on enemies."

Piper's next attack is a seeking bullet that will curve towards the nearest enemy. The homing bullets fly for an additional 3.33 tiles. A Gadget symbol will glow above Piper's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after this attack is shot.
Star Powers
Ambush
"Piper's attack deals +800 extra damage (at max range) when she's hidden in a bush."

When Piper is hidden within a bush, her main attack gains 800 bonus damage, allowing her to deal 2928 damage at maximum range. The bullet also gets a rainbow trail replacing the standard rings. Piper's ammunition bar becomes yellow instead of the usual orange when hidden inside a bush. The sound of the shot is also altered with a somewhat layered sound of her normal shots place on top of it.
Snappy Sniping
"When Piper hits an enemy with her attack, she reloads 0.4 ammo instantly."

Upon hitting an enemy, Piper instantly reloads 0.4 ammo, increasing her reload speed. If Piper hits turrets or minions (such as Nita's bear), it will also activate. This also includes hits from her Auto Aimer Gadget.
Tips

    Piper is effective when hidden inside bushes (with or without Ambush) in open areas because she can utilize her high range faraway without giving her location.
    Piper's range is very decieving due to the fast speed of the bullets. Don't underestimate a Piper's range. If you are a more close-ranged brawler juke her shots by moving side to side while steadily advancing to her. Piper is only easy to defeat at close range, otherwise she will definitely put up a good fight from long range.
    Piper can be overwhelmed and defeated easily if she is unprotected due to her low health and very slow reload, as well as the fact that she only does sufficient damage from distance. Piper is most effective when she is covered by other Brawlers on her team. If enemies do get too close, it may be a good idea to use Piper's Super to escape if the Super is charged. You need to aim too because otherwise, you land in the place from where you jumped.
    Try to predict your target's movement when firing. Piper's shots are narrow, so you will need to aim ahead of your targets if they are moving so that they do not move out of the way of the shot.
    Piper has a very defensive Super since it only affects the area right near her, but it can also be used offensively in a riskier play. Piper can rush the enemy team, drop the grenades, and fly away. In addition, she can use her Super to destroy enemy cover to open up the map. This plays to her advantage because her long range is more effective in open maps.
    When escaping, always try your best to aim Piper away from the enemy rather than auto-aiming because if you quickfire her super, she will only land in the place from where she activated her super, without covering any distance. However if you are in a very pressurized situation and your enemy has short range, you can quickfire the super because the knockback of the grenades is reliable to distance yourself from them. However, always aim the landing point when you can.
    Piper's Super can be used to shape the map to your advantage, destroying walls which your opponents would otherwise be hiding behind. This is especially useful on maps such as Shooting Star, where there isn't much cover to begin with. Due to Piper's very low damage at close range and her low health, she cannot afford to be ambushed by tanks at close range and instead must have an open area which tanks have to cross to get to her, allowing Piper to position herself well and attack the enemy.
    Charge up Piper's Super as a priority, as there are Brawlers that can pop right in such as Darryl, Bull, Mortis, and Edgar. If you have your Auto Aimer Gadget, use it primarily to escape as its offensive capabilities are negligible.
    Assassin Brawlers are a major counter to Piper due to their above-average speed and abilities that help them dodge and reach her very easily (Mortis's dash, Crow's and Leon's Supers, etc.), so it is best to avoid and keep an eye on them from distance.
    Think carefully when it comes to the position of Piper's landing after her Super. Since it takes a long time for her to land, it is easy for the enemy to predict where she will end up. Try going to places that the enemy will take a long time to reach such as across water regions or behind walls, but make sure you do not land close to the location of other enemies.
    Due to Piper's attack mechanics, she is very likely to have boxes stolen in Showdown as attacking boxes at close range will be very time consuming due to her very slow reload speed and low damage. When breaking down a box at range and an enemy is close to it, target the enemy instead until they are fended off or defeated and then continue with the box.
    Piper's Auto Aimer Gadget can be used to stop Brawlers who are pursuing her at close range since her main attack does very little damage at close range. It can also help Piper land her narrow shots. Since the movement speed of her enemy will be decreased, she can hit them more easily, or alternatively, she can use their reduced movement speed to escape.
    Piper's Homemade Recipe Gadget can be used to defeat low health enemies hiding behind walls or to increase the chances of hitting an enemy Brawler at low health to guarantee their defeat. Piper can also take advantage of the extra range of her Gadget to finish off enemies that are out of her attack range.
    Since Homemade Recipe homes in on Brawlers and determines their location to an extent, it's a good idea to use it when you know someone is in bushes but don't know where they are. This works best on small bushes, as large bushes will be too large for the curvature of the bullet to reach. <br><br><br><br><br>
    MYTHIC BRAWLERS: <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/4/41/Byron_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20210106213109" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Byron is a Mythic Brawler who can deal moderate tick damage to enemies and provide a great amount of healing to his team, but has low health and insufficient burst damage. His attack is a long-ranged dart that both damages enemies and heals allies over time. His Super lobs a vial that damages/heals all respective targets in its splash radius upon impact. His Gadget, Shot in the Arm, consumes one ammo to heal him over time. His first Star Power, Malaise, momentarily but drastically reduces any healing for enemies hit by his Super. His second Star Power, Injection, makes his attack pierce through Brawlers periodically.
Attack: Careful Dose
"Shoots a long range dart that can hit both opponents and friendlies. Opponents will take damage over time and friendlies will heal over time."

Byron shoots a single long-ranged dart, dealing three ticks of damage over time to enemies. However, if the dart hits an ally, it instead heals them over time for the same amount of health as damage to an enemy. The damage/healing effects stack, meaning you can attack the same enemy or heal the same teammate multiple times to increase its effects. The healing also scales with buffs, such as Power Cubes in Duo Showdown and 8-BIT's Super. Byron’s attack takes roughly 0.5 seconds to complete, but has a very fast reload speed.
Super: Full Treatment
"Throws a vial that heals friendlies and damages opponents."

Byron lobs a vial that can be thrown over walls which instantaneously heals both himself and allies and damage enemies within a 2.67 tile splash radius upon impact.
Gadget: Shot In The Arm
"Byron uses one of his shots to heal himself 800 per second for 3 seconds."

Byron consumes one ammo bar while healing him 800 health per second for 3 seconds, healing a total of 2400 health. There’s a slight delay upon activation, similar to his attack.
Star Powers
Malaise
"Byron's Super will also cause opponents to receive 75% less healing from any source for the next 9 seconds."

With this Star Power, enemies hit by Byron's Super heal for quarter as much health from any healing source for 9 seconds. This affects healing from Gadgets, Star Powers, Supers, and healing attacks (i.e. Edgar), along with Healing Mushrooms, and self-healing. This doesn’t affect Max's Sneaky Sneakers Gadget.
Injection
"Every 3.5 seconds the next basic attack will pierce through targets."

With this Star Power, a bar appears over Byron, similar to Bibi's Home Run bar. When the bar is charged up (after 3.5 seconds), Byron’s next attack pierces through any target. Like Sprout‘s Overgrowth Star Power, Byron doesn’t require all three ammo for charge the bar.
Tips

    Since his range is long but his unload speed is slow, sharpshooting skills, such as aiming ahead of the enemy's direction of travel, are needed to utilize Byron well. However, with his faster projectile speed, aiming with Byron is easier than with other long-ranged Brawlers such as Brock or Bea.
    In one-on-one fights or Solo events, you’ll need to utilize Byron well. Focus on using the stacking tick damage to chip away at the enemy/enemies from a distance while also dodging their counter fire, and once they’re low on health, use your Super to finish them off. Byron has low health, but his Shot In The Arm Gadget along with his Super, when used on himself, compensates for it and allows him to survive much longer than other Brawlers with similar health.
    Byron's long range, tick damage, and healing abilities truly shine in 3v3 or other Team events because he can heal his teammates consistently while they work towards the respective game objective with the healing giving more ease. Healing allies who are the Gem carriers in Gem Grab, carrying Bolts or attacking the enemy IKE in Siege, attacking the enemy safe in Heist, capturing a zone in Hot Zone, carrying many stars in Bounty, attacking the Boss in Big Game or Super City Rampage, carrying a present in Present Plunder, killing a team in Duo Showdown or Knockout, and carrying/scoring the Ball in Brawl Ball almost guarantees a positive outcome as the healing decreases enemy damage while assisting allies. In addition, he’s also effective at preventing enemy healing with his tick damage, making it easier to cripple the enemy team. Using Byron's Super when he or multiple allies are near each other increases the healing value. You can use his Super at close-range, so your Super both heals you and damages enemies while inside the Super’s radius.
    Byron is outstanding at supporting tanks or assassins like Edgar, especially in Duo Showdown, as Byron's allies can play aggressively, and if applicable, ambush enemies with their Supers (i.e. Edgar’s or Crow’s Super etc.) while Byron can consistently and quickly heal them from a safe range.
    Auto-aiming your main attack prioritizes the closest Brawler to you, ally or enemy. When fighting alongside a teammate, manually aim to hit the enemy, and even if you have his Injection Star Power and you can chain attacks to hit both allies and enemies, you should still maintain a safe distance away from teammates that is far enough to damage enemies but close enough to heal allies without the disadvantages of long-range aiming.
    Byron functions well with 8-BIT as 8-BIT's damage booster also boosts Byron's healing abilities drastically and Byron can use this to heal 8-BIT who already has high health. This combination is very effective in Duo Showdown. The combo is also extremely devastating in Siege; if the team dives into the enemy IKE turret's range to attack it, the boosted healing from Byron will momentarily protect 8-BIT while he uses his high and boosted damage and his Extra Credits Gadget to take out a major portion, if not all, of the IKE's health. Conversely, these two Brawlers in an enemy team should be monitored closely and be approached with caution.
    Byron is also solid for Super City Rampage as he can heal allies while they aggressively attack the Boss. An excellent team composition in this event is himself (with his Injection Star Power), Pam (preferably with her Mama's Squeeze Star Power in this case), and a Brawler who can stall the Boss for a long duration, such as Edgar/Nita. For Edgar, he should use his Fisticuffs Star Power; for Nita, her Bear With Me Star Power is much more useful. If Edgar is the stalling Brawler, he can continuously damage the Boss with his increased healing along with Pam’s and Byron’s healing, he should be able to overcome the Boss's damage. For Nita, she should charge up her Super and spawn Bruce near the Boss opposite Nita, and Nita should take turns taking blows with Bruce. Again, with Pam's and Byron's healing, Nita can withstand more damage, and while attacking the Boss, she can heal Bruce. <br><br><br><br><br>

Gene is a Mythic Brawler who has a moderate health and damage. For his attack, his lamp spews out a ball of smoke that splits after a certain range. Gene's Super pulls an enemy and drags them to Gene's location. His first Gadget, Lamp Blowout, pushes back all nearby enemies, healing him a small amount. His second Gadget, Vengeful Spirits, fires multiple projectiles that home in on enemies in range and scale in damage the further they travel. His first Star Power, Magic Puffs, slightly heals his allies over time when they’re near him. His second Star Power, Spirit Slap, increases the damage of his attack when his Super is charged up.
Attack: Smoke Blast
"Gene shoots a solid ball of magical smoke from his lamp. If the ball doesn't hit a target, it splits up and spreads the damage in a cone."

Gene shoots a medium-ranged ball that deals damage and travels relatively slowly. If it doesn’t hit a target, it splits up into 6 projectiles that spread out in a cone (in a similar way to Penny). The damage is equally distributed between them, and they travel for an additional 5.33 tiles. Unlike Penny, the shots don’t split on contact with an enemy.
Super: Magic Hand
"Gene launches a magical hand from his lamp. If the hand hits an enemy, they get pulled back to Gene's location!"

Gene shoots a long-ranged hand that passes through obstacles. If it hits an enemy Brawler, it pulls the opponent to Gene, destroying all obstacles the enemy goes through in the meantime. Gene can also attack an enemy while pulling them, but the hand itself doesn't deal damage. The magical hand won’t destroy obstacles if Gene doesn't grab anyone. His pull isn’t interrupted if his target gets hit by a Gem Grab minecart in Minecart Madness.
Gadgets
Lamp Blowout
"All enemies close to Gene are instantly pushed back. Gene also restores 600 health."

Upon activation, Gene creates a wave with a 2.67 tile radius around himself that pushes away all enemies away from him while simultaneously healing Gene for 600 health. Using this Gadget halts the natural healing process. Unlike most healing abilities, Gene can still activate the Gadget at full health.
Vengeful Spirits
"Gene shoots a homing missile at all visible enemies within a large area, dealing up to 800 damage based on distance."

Upon activation, Gene shoots homing missiles towards all visible enemies within a 11 tile radius area, dealing from 230 to 800 damage the further they travel. The missiles have a 0.33 width and 2500-point speed but keeps chasing the enemy until they hit them or if they hit a wall. Note that the homing missiles can’t target enemies that are invisible or hiding within a bush.
Star Powers
Magic Puffs
"Gene heals all friendly Brawlers around him for 400 health per second."

Within a 4 tile radius of Gene, all friendly Brawlers will be healed 400 health per second. This doesn’t apply to Gene himself, or spawnables (i.e Scrappy, Tick's Head). This Star Power won’t reveal Gene's hitbox, but it reveals the healing radius.
Spirit Slap
"When Gene's Super is fully charged he does +300 damage with his attack."

This increases Gene's attack damage by 300 once his Super is fully charged up, for a total of 1812 damage. This also increases the damage from the splitting projectiles of his attack by 50. The effect is lost if Gene uses his Super.
Tips

    Gene can extend his Super's pull by walking backwards as soon as it launches. It is also extended if Gene uses a launch pad while firing his Super, or if he teleports.
    While an enemy is being pulled by Gene, they are unable to do anything. It is therefore recommended to start shooting at them the moment you have grabbed them and not afterwards.
    In Duo Showdown, Gene can be deadly when paired up with short-ranged and high-damaging Brawlers like Bull, as pulling someone allows teammates finish them off easily. This is made more consistent because Gene can charge his Super again with four complete attacks.
    Gene's Super interrupts enemy attacks and Supers, so he can stop Carl's Super and Frank from landing his Super, etc.
    Gene's Super is an incredibly useful tool that can turn the tide of a game. It can target the highest-value target in modes such as Bounty and Gem Grab, dragging them into your team for an easy burst-down. It is also a great way to engage low-health enemies.
    His Super can be used very effectively in Big Game to drag the Boss toward your group of allies so that they can deal extra damage, unless they’re low-health sharpshooters with higher damage at long range such as Bea or Piper.
    The effectiveness of Gene's Super can be more significant when used in Events with Modifiers active. It can be used to pull enemies into the area where meteors are going to land, pull them into robots, or pull them away from energy drinks and healing mushrooms. His Super can also be used to pull enemies into the poison gas.
    In Siege, Gene can pull the Siege Robot away from the IKE with his Super. Alternatively, he can use his Gadget to instead push the Siege Robot away. These tactics can give his team more time to defeat the Siege Bot and prevent it from defeating the IKE. Gene can also pull enemies into the range of his team's turret to have the turret quickly defeat them (unless the turret is attacking another target, so it is advised to only do this when there isn’t any Siege).
    When using Gene’s Super, be aware of who your target is. Avoid using it on a heavyweight, Edgar, Leon, or a Brawler with a dangerous Super charged, like Shelly or Carl (if he uses his Super after you pull him with yours), and in case of Showdown, an opponent with a large amount of Power Cubes; doing so in these situations will most likely result in backfire. If you do accidentally use your Super on the above Brawlers, make sure to use your Lamp Blowout Gadget to push them back, giving you time and distance to attack or escape from them.
    Gene's pull has priority over every object/entity in the game except against another Gene that is pulling someone. This means Gene can pull enemies into minecarts in Minecart Madness to deal 2000 damage. Gene can also make use of his Gadget Lamp Blowout to push enemies into the minecarts.
    Since Gene's attack has a very wide spread angle, it is very effective at checking bushes. His attack is also really effective at dealing small chip damage that prevents enemies from healing, similar to Crow's poison.
    Gene’s Magic Puffs Star Power won’t be activated at any time in Solo events due to the lack of teammates, so always use his Spirit Slap Star Power in Solo events. Spirit Slap can be used as a great finish to low-health enemies, and it can increase your damage output effectively as long as your Super isn’t used.
    Gene is especially powerful when paired with Max, as Gene can heal Max with his Magic Puffs Star Power while she provides consistent damage, and Max's speed boost from her Super allows Gene to consistently land Supers. This combination is also extremely deadly in 3v3 modes.
    Gene's Super will guarantee to hit an enemy if auto-aimed at a relatively close range. Be aware that you may pull an unexpected target so make sure to aim it if you want to guarantee a hit on a certain enemy or if you are pulling at a long range. <br><br><br><br><br>

Max is a Mythic Brawler with moderate health, a moderate damage output, and a very fast movement speed. For her attack, Max rapidly fires 4 long-ranged projectiles in a slight spread. Her Super momentarily boosts the movement speed of her and nearby allies. Her first Gadget, Phase Shifter, makes her dash in the direction she is facing and gain an immunity shield while dashing. Her second Gadget, Sneaky Sneakers, creates a teleporting location icon that she teleports back to after 3 seconds with her initial health. Her first Star Power, Super Charged, automatically charges her Super while she’s moving. Her second Star Power, Run n' Gun, increases her reload speed while she's moving.
Attack: Faster Blaster
"Max's blaster shoots a bunch of projectiles fast! It holds a lot of rounds, and Max is quick with the reload."

Max rapidly shoots 4 staggered long-ranged projectiles from her blaster with a slight spread. She uniquely has four ammo slots, and her ammo reloads quickly. The attack has a short cooldown, taking 0.55 seconds to complete.

Super: Let's Go!
"Max momentarily boosts up her movement speed and that of nearby allies. Gotta go fast!"

Max drinks an energy drink bottle and creates an area-of-effect around her that lasts for 1 second and increases the movement speed of her and teammates inside the area-of-effect by 300 points for 4 seconds. Her teammates retain the movement speed boost even after leaving the radius.
Gadgets
Phase Shifter
"Max dashes forward, and becomes immune to all damage from enemies while dashing."

Max dashes 3.33 tiles in the direction she faces, gaining an immunity shield while dashing. However, her dash is interrupted if she dashes into walls or water. Status effects, stuns, and knockbacks can still be applied during the dash and she still retains any pre-existing status effects. This doesn’t affect her Super Charged Star Power's Super charging speed.
Sneaky Sneakers
"Max blinks back to a place of her choosing after 3.0 seconds delay, recovering any damage she received in the meantime."

Upon activation, Max places a thunderbolt icon at her current location, gaining a Gadget symbol above her head and a bar that counts down to 3 seconds. After those 3 seconds, she teleports back to the icon with the health she had at activation time. If she had any status effects, such as Crow or Byron’s poison, she retains the status effects. However, if she is defeated before she teleports, her Gadget charge is consumed, but she won’t teleport.
Star Powers
Super Charged
"Max now charges her Super while moving."

Max’s Super automatically recharges while moving, similar to Darryl and Edgar. Her Super stops charging when she's not moving. If she keeps moving, it takes around 68 seconds to fully charge up without any speed boosts, which increase the Super charge rate.
Run n' Gun
"Max reloads faster while moving."

Max’s attack reloads slightly faster than normal while moving. This is affected by Max's movement speed; she reloads faster if she has a movement speed boost (like her Super), than if she doesn't, which is similar to her Super Charged Star Power. Her reload speed is approximately 11% faster when moving at normal speed, and 15.77% faster with her Super.
Tips

    Max can act like an assassin, using her fast reload speed and attack cooldown to burst enemies down and her movement speed to dodge enemy fire. After getting within range, follow and chip away at enemies until you eliminate them. If they manage to somehow escape, such as with Edgar’s Super, use your Super and/or her Phase Shifter Gadget and rush them.
    Max's Super can be used to catch up to fleeing enemies or ensure an easier escape from pursuing enemies. This makes her good with guerrilla tactics because she can rush in with her Super, deal a lot of damage, and escape with her Super before she takes any serious damage.
    Auto-aiming at long range with Max, in most cases, will hit 3 of her projectiles. Because of this, auto-aiming is a good strategy while playing Max, but most of the time enemies are moving. Practice mirroring the enemy's movement to hit all 4 projectiles, and at the tip of her range, it’s good to use practices commonly applied to sharpshooters.
    To make use of Max's Star Powers, don’t stand still. Even spinning in place can make use of the Star Powers.
    Max's attack has a range similar to Tara's, and while it doesn't deal much damage if only one projectile hits, the fact that Max has 4 ammo slots, coupled with her much faster reload speed, attack cooldown, and tighter spread, means she can consistently provide suppressive fire and chip away at enemies, unlike most long-ranged Brawlers who reload slower.
    Max's Super Charged Star Power works better in team events like Gem Grab or Hot Zone where Max will need to play as a support. Her Run n' Gun Star Power allows her to maintain the damage output of a typical sharpshooter and is preferred in Special Event modes like Boss Fight, Super City Rampage, and Robo Rumble, where her Super Charged Star Power charges her Super less efficiently than normal. In Showdown, choose your Star Power based on your play style; use Super Charged if you’re bush-camping for your Super to ambush enemies, and use Run n' Gun if you’ll be picking fights and collecting Power Cubes.
    Max can use her Phase Shifter Gadget to absorb a high-damaging projectile like Nani's Peep to survive at crucial times or for a valuable teammate in order to help them survive. This, however, requires precise timing. Similarly, as long as you have sufficiently high health, Max can use her Sneaky Sneakers Gadget to absorb multiple projectiles and then teleport back safely with full health.
    Max's Sneaky Sneakers Gadget allows her to play aggressively for 3 seconds without major repercussions. After dropping it on the ground, take time pressuring enemies before returning to her original location for better opportunities. Do note that high-damaging enemies such as Bull can ambush you when you teleport to your original location, as the location is made obvious by the icon Max leaves upon activating the Gadget, so therefore, refrain from using the Gadget near bushes or enemy spawn points.
    Max's Sneaky Sneakers Gadget is useful in Showdown when you want to defeat a vulnerable enemy such as a thrower but you are in danger of being third-partied by someone else. You can drop your Sneaky Sneakers Gadget and then try defeating the enemy. You’ll likely be low on health after fighting the enemy, and will be a target for other enemies, but you’ll teleport back to your Gadget's location and regain lost health. All the same, make sure to use this Gadget only when you're away from enemies, or contained by obstacles to avoid being ambushed where you’ll teleport. Also, avoid staying too far from the Gadget location with your Super, because you'll never know who’s attempting to ambush you when you return, and you should save your Super as an escape tool for such situations. <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/b/b2/Mortis_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20200520104613" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Mortis is a Mythic Brawler who has above-average health, a fast movement speed, and great mobility with his attack at the expense of a low damage output and an extremely slow reload speed. He attacks by swinging his shovel and dashing a few tiles forward, dealing damage to enemies in his path. His Super summons a swarm of bats that drain the health of enemies while restoring his own health. His first Gadget, Combo Spinner, makes him instantly spin his shovel around him, dealing damage to nearby enemies. His second Gadget, Survival Shovel, doubles his reload speed for 4 seconds. His first Star Power, Creepy Harvest, heals him when he defeats an enemy Brawler. His second Star Power, Coiled Snake, gives him a bar that charges for a few seconds after he gets 3 ammo, and when fully charged, it increases his next attack's dash range.

Attack: Shovel Swing
"Mortis dashes forward with a sharp swing of his shovel, creating business opportunities for himself."

Mortis dashes forward a short distance, dealing minor damage to any enemy Brawlers in his path. Mortis can’t perform his attack without dashing unless he dashes toward a nearby wall. If Mortis dashes into a wall mid-dash, his dash is cut short. This attack is technically a melee attack, because the dash gives it a short range. Mortis has the slowest reload speed of any Brawler in the game.
Super: Life Blood
"Mortis calls forth a swarm of vampire bats that drain the health of his enemies while restoring his. Creepy!"

Mortis shoots a swarm of bats in a single direction that can go through walls. If the bats hit an enemy Brawler, they deal damage and heal Mortis for 125% of the full amount possible for his Super’s level even if the enemy hit has less health left than its maximum damage. If the bats miss, Mortis doesn’t heal. The bats move quickly and travel far, making this difficult to avoid. If the bats hit multiple enemies, they deal the full damage and the healing Mortis receives is multiplied by the number of enemies hit, making it possible for Mortis to heal to full health if the bats hit several enemies.
Gadgets
Combo Spinner
"Mortis spins his shovel, hitting all enemies around himself for 1300 damage."

Mortis quickly spins around on the spot, damaging all enemies in a 3.33 tile radius for 1300 damage. He can still move, but can’t use his attack during this Gadget's duration.
Survival Shovel
"Mortis reloads faster for 4.0 seconds."

Upon activation, Mortis appears red and double his reload speed for 4 seconds. This doesn’t affect Coiled Snake's Dash Bar.
Star Powers
Creepy Harvest
"Mortis reaps the life essence of a Brawler he defeats, restoring 1800 of his health."

Mortis heals himself for 1800 health after defeating an enemy Brawler.
Coiled Snake
"Mortis gains a Dash Bar! His dash range is increased by 75% when the bar is fully charged. It takes 3.5 seconds for the bar to charge when Mortis has all three dashes ready."

When Mortis has his ammo bar full, a bar starts charging, which can be seen below the ammo bar. The bar takes 3.5 seconds to fully charge, and once it fully charges, his next attack's dash range is increased by 75% (4.67 tiles), allowing him to travel further. The bar's charging mechanics are comparable to Bibi's Home Run bar.
Tips

    The dash that comes with Mortis' main attack makes him highly mobile. He can quickly attack and dash away and out of danger, making it difficult to land hits on him. He can also retreat quickly due to his above-average movement speed and his Survival Shovel Gadget.
    When retreating/escaping, avoid auto-aiming since you’ll dash into the enemy you’re trying to escape from. Also, dashing to the side is favorable as opposed to dashing forward since you can dodge attacks better. Still, try to conserve your ammo, and if equipped with Mortis's Survival Shovel Gadget, use it sparingly in case you need to retreat.
    Mortis' Super can act as a powerful fourth attack in tight situations. Use it when he’s low on health and needs to heal quickly. Try to hit as many enemies as possible with the Super so that he recovers more health and charges his Super again much faster. It also has considerable range and travels quite quickly, which can be used to snipe low-health Brawlers even through walls.
    Mortis' reload speed is the slowest in the entire game, which means that after you defeat an enemy, you should immediately retreat and reload. If you’re using his Coiled Snake Star Power, try charging it up before eliminating other Brawlers or escaping. If getting that extra range becomes a necessity, his Survival Shovel Gadget should be the useful asset.
    Mortis' Creepy Harvest heals him for a considerable amount when defeating an enemy Brawler. It’s sometimes necessary to be kept alive while taking fire from enemy Brawlers. However, this Star Power isn’t ideal in open maps such as Purple Paradise in Bounty because you’ll be easily get outranged by enemies, so instead, use your Coiled Snake Star Power in open maps in order to catch up to enemies more easily.
    In Brawl Ball, you can self-pass by kicking the ball and dashing twice to pick it up again. If fast enough, you’ll only need one dash to pick up the ball again to conserve ammo. You can also use your Super to shoot the Ball (even on the side of the map) and dash forward onto the Ball (preferably with his Coiled Snake Star Power or his Survival Shovel Gadget) to move the ball down the field extremely quickly. To do this, allow your teammates to distract the opposition, then quickly self-pass and score the goal.
    Mortis' Coiled Snake Star Power allows him to close a significant gap between enemies and gives him a chance to get closer to enemies. Using this Star Power effectively requires preparation and being unpredictable, such as bush-camping and attacking when someone comes near. Using this Star Power also allows him to get close to certain close-ranged Brawlers and dash to slash through the Brawler and out of their range. This can be used repeatedly to charge Mortis’ Super while taking minimal damage.
    In both Showdown/Duo Showdown, you can’t check bushes, so if you are moving into an unknown bush, be ready to dash away very quickly. Pre-aiming his attack away from the bush also helps, as once you see the enemy, you can instantly dash away from them with your high mobility. His Coiled Snake Star Power helps when going into a bush to check it. His Survival Shovel Gadget is also helpful to escape better from enemies camping in the bush. Take caution that Mortis is prone to defeat by bush-camping Brawlers like Shelly and El Primo due to their superior damage and health, so caution is highly recommended when going into a bush which likely has an enemy in it.
    In Showdown, Mortis can do well by simply bush-camping and staying out of fights, dashing away when necessary. If you see a fight between other Brawlers, you can play as a Third-Party by waiting out-of-sight nearby until the fight is over, then dash in and defeat the surviving and low-health Brawler, then steal all the Power Cubes and escape. Mortis's Coiled Snake Star Power and Survival Shovel Gadget greatly helps for this strategy.
    In Gem Grab, Mortis is a decent Gem carrier due to his moderately high health and ability to dash and retrieve Gems quicker, dashing away if on low health. However, he requires support from his teammates to survive, because he needs to get dangerously close to enemies and the Gem mine. This is treacherous at higher trophy levels though, because this leaves your teammates at a 2v3 situation.
    Mortis’ single-target focus combined with his extremely slow reload speed makes him a poor choice for Events such as Heist and any Special Event due to the low damage output applied to the modes’ targets (i.e. the safe, the bosses, etc.) in Robo Rumble, Super City Rampage, and Boss Fight.
    At the start of a Showdown match, try to go for defeats rather than boxes as it takes a long time and it’s very likely to be stolen. Pick off long-ranged Brawlers with relatively low health like Dynamike or Rico while juking shots. Bush-camping and surprising enemies also works well. However, don’t get hit by those enemies’ dangerous Supers or Gadgets (i.e. Rico’s, Colt‘s, Piper‘s, etc.). Make sure to also avoid Dynamike's Satchel Charge Gadget, because it can stun and be detrimental to you.
    Mortis' Combo Spinner Gadget is more fit for a quick finish to Brawlers when you have no ammo or when you need to deal damage to a group of enemies. On the other hand, his Survival Shovel Gadget is more efficient in the long-term when taking out high-health Brawlers or when retreating.
    When defending in Brawl Ball, try to aim backwards instead of auto-aiming when an enemy is near your goal. This gives you the chance to dash back and catch the Ball, therefore preventing a goal.
    Mortis can counter Bibi as Mortis can keep dashing through Bibi during the delay before her attack, dealing damage to her while avoiding her attacks. However, this requires a lot of skill and timing, and should be done with his Survival Shovel Gadget for better results. You can firstly dash behind her to surprise her, then use your Survival Shovel Gadget, and while Bibi is attacking behind her, dash in front of her to dash the second attack, and then repeat this process. This also works (but is riskier) with Frank.
    Mortis is excellent at performing team wipes, especially with his Combo Spinner Gadget and Coiled Snake Star Power. If the enemies are grouped up, you can ambush them, activate his Gadget, and chain Supers. The healing from his Super ensures that he stays alive. Hitting multiple enemies with his Super also helps him survive longer and heal even more. However, avoid attacking heavyweights or other assassins like Bull, El Primo, Edgar, or Leon as they’ll defeat him if he gets too close to them due to their superior damage output and incredibly faster reload speeds than Mortis. <br><br><br><br><br>

Mr. P is a Mythic Brawler who has moderate health and damage. He attacks with suitcases that bounce upon hitting an enemy and deal additional damage. His Super deploys a home base that periodically spawns a robo-porter that follows and attacks enemies. His first Gadget, Service Bell, significantly increases the damage and health of the current porter. His second Gadget, Porter Reinforcements, spawns a weaker porter at the end of Mr. P's next attack’s range. Mr. P's first Star Power, Handle With Care, allows his attack to bounce at the end of its range even if it doesn't hit a target or obstacle. His second Star Power, Revolving Door, makes his porters spawn sooner when the current one is destroyed.
Attack: Your Suitcase Sir!
"Mr. P throws a heavy suitcase with angry intent. If the suitcase hits an obstacle or an opponent, it bounces over them, lands with a bang and deals area damage."

Mr. P throws a suitcase at an enemy. If the suitcase hits a target or an obstacle, it bounces over them, dealing splash damage upon hitting the ground. The bounces extend the attack's range by 3 tiles.

Super: Porters! Attack!
"Mr. P deploys the home base for his robo-porters. He has reprogrammed the small penguin-head robots to attack and harass opponents (and unruly guests)."

Mr. P throws a home base with moderate health. It can be thrown anywhere within a short distance from Mr. P. The home base is stationary and spawns robo-porters with low health and damage to assist Mr. P and his allies. The porters move relatively fast towards the nearest target, and when they get within the range of the target, they stop and shoot it with short-ranged shots. The porters keep spawning until the home base is destroyed. However, there can only be one robo-porter from Mr. P's Super on the battlefield at a time. The home base has a 4 second delay before it can spawn another robo-porter after one is destroyed. There can be only one home base on the battlefield at a time, unless there are multiple Mr. Ps.
Gadgets
Service Bell
"Mr. P buffs his current porter by increasing its damage by 150 and health by 1000."

Mr. P increases the damage of the current porter by 150 and its health by 1000. This only applies to the one porter on the battlefield. This will also heal the porter to maximum health. The buffed porter appears bigger in size with a purple glow on it (similar an Energy Drink effect). Mr. P must be within 12 tiles of his current porter to use this Gadget. Buffs are only applied to a porter once.
Porter Reinforcements
"The next attack will spawn a weak porter where the attack lands."

Mr. P's next attack spawns a porter mechanically identical to his Super at the end of the attack's range. Porters spawned from this Gadget have half the health and 77% times the damage of a porter spawned by Mr. P's Super. They’re also visually smaller than their Super counterparts. The porters spawned from his Gadget won’t despawn even if Mr. P uses another Gadget, allowing multiple porters to be on the battlefield at once. His attack still deals its base damage before spawning a porter, and this Gadget can be affected by his Handle With Care Star Power. A Gadget symbol will glow above Mr. P's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after this attack is shot.
Star Powers
Handle With Care
"Mr. P's overstuffed suitcases bounce and burst even if they don't hit a target or obstacle."

This Star Power allows Mr. P's attack to bounce even if it doesn’t hit any target or obstacle. This increases his maximum range to 10 tiles; however, there is a break-point after the bounce which slows down the attack and decreases the unload speed. This Star Power affects the spawn point from Porter Reinforcements.
Revolving Door
"The robo-porters spawn 3 seconds faster after being defeated."

This Star Power makes the porters spawn faster when the one is defeated. Normally, after a porter is defeated, it takes 4 seconds to respawn, but Revolving Door cuts it down by 3 seconds, so a new one spawns 1 second after the previous one is defeated, making them respawn a lot more faster.
Tips

    Mr. P's attack is unique in that it bounces after hitting am obstacle or target. If you throw attacks at walls, you can hit enemies behind them, like a thrower. This only works with one-tile-thick walls. If you hit a Brawler, the attack can hit them again if they stand still or are running away from you, effectively doubling your damage per hit against fleeing targets.
    In Special Events such as Boss Fight, Robo Rumble and Big Game, Mr. P's Super can prove very useful as the porters can distract the enemies, and if a porter is destroyed, another one spawns to take its place. His Revolving Door Star Power makes this more of a threat.
    Continue to set up a home base when taking control of lanes in battles. Mr. P's Super can be charged consistently which allows them to secure control faster using their Super. It also means it's safe to bring the base further into the battlefield where it can be of more use. Take into note that sometimes spawning a new home base is better then that of waiting for a porter to spawn since a porter immediately spawns right when it's placed down (though this is really only necessary without his Revolving Door Star Power).
    Mr. P's Handle With Care Star Power makes his suitcases bounce even if they don’t hit an enemy or obstacle, making him more threatening in open areas and effectively increasing his range.
    Mr. P is a very versatile Brawler due to his pseudo-thrower attacks and his range. Taking note of the enemy's movement and position can be vital when dealing maximum damage with the bounce from his attack.
    On maps with an abundance of walls, it's usually a good idea to use his Revolving Door Star Power as you can usually utilize the extra bounce from the given walls without needing Mr. P's Handle with Care Star Power. The walls also give opportunities to the porters to corner enemies
    In Siege, throwing your home base inside the IKE zone can serve as a meat shield for you as long as it is closer to the IKE, causing the IKE to target it instead of you. This gives you more time to dive into the IKE to land extra shots and is amplified with his Revolving Door Star Power, which can spawn porters quicker and therefore give you an even better meat shield.
    In a pinch, his porters can be used as a meat shield to hide behind them and heal up or attack the enemy. This should only be used in situations like Showdown or the last few seconds in Bounty or Siege. Watch out for Penny, Jessie, and other piercing or bouncing Brawlers though, since they can hit through spawnables, including Mr. P's porters.
    Mr. P can be a real nuisance on maps a plethora of bushes, such as Snake Prairie, as his porters can flush out hidden enemies. This strategy works even better with his Revolving Door Star Power because if one Porter is defeated, another one quickly spawns and follow the enemy, giving away their position, and it’s better amplified with his Porter Reinforcements Gadget, because of the extra porters spawned to detect enemies.
    Mr. P’s Porter Reinforcements Gadget is a good way to block shots from enemies, making them expend their ammo on the porter despite its low health. Using his Porter Reinforcements Gadget is also a good way to find enemies or scout out the area. You can spawn one down and then follow the porter until you find an enemy.
    Mr. P's Porter Reinforcements Gadget can also effectively counter Brawlers that have difficulty defending themselves at close range such as Piper or Brawlers with low damage or a slow reload speed. Throwing the porters right before an enemy can sometimes force them to retreat, allowing Mr. P to hit them with his attack and deal twice the damage.
    When trying to counter a Mr. P, though, don't run away from him or else you’ll take doubled damage and are likely to be defeated. Go towards Mr. P instead so you won’t take as much damage and might even catch up to him and defeat him, similar to how you counter Emz. <br><br><br><br><br>

Sprout is a Mythic Brawler with moderate health and a moderate damage output, but immense utility with its Super. It attacks by throwing a seed bomb over obstacles that bounces on the ground and off walls. The bomb explodes on contact with enemies or after a set period of time, dealing area damage. For its Super, Sprout throws a Super Seed, creating a temporary wall-like barrier when it lands. Its first Gadget, Garden Mulcher, makes Sprout consume a nearby bush tile and moderately heal from it’s consumption. Sprout's second Gadget, Transplant, destroys all active hedges from its Super to get its Super fully charged again. Its first Star Power, Overgrowth, increases the blast radius of its next attack every five seconds. Its second Star Power, Photosynthesis, grants it a damage-reducing shield while inside a bush and for a brief time after leaving it.

Attack: Seed Bomb
"Sprout propels a ball of seeds that bounces around before bursting with a bang! If it makes contact with enemies, it explodes on impact."

Sprout lobs a ball of seeds over obstacles and enemies in its path that explodes on contact with an enemy. If it doesn’t hit an enemy, it will bounce a few tiles further and off walls, before exploding in a 1 tile radius. The attack travels farther when bouncing off of walls.
Super: Hedge
"Sprout uses its Super Seed to grow a thick vine hedge, creating an impassable though temporary obstacle."

Sprout throws its Super Seed above obstacles that creates a hedge barrier. It creates a 5-tile cross pattern from the center of the seed and the seed blocks enemies' and allies' paths. However, if there are nearby walls to where the seed was planted, the hedge will grow towards them and connect with the walls. As with any other wall, the hedge can be destroyed by wall-breaking abilities and do not hinder lobbed projectiles These hedges can also be destroyed on contact by Brawlers with spawning invulnerability shields.

The hedges can last for a maximum of 10 seconds, and more than one hedge can be placed on the battlefield. If any entity is in the way of the hedges when spawned, they will be pushed out of the way, canceling unloading attacks or Supers (i.e. Frank's attack) when the hedge lands. The hedges will also destroy any bushes it lands on.

Sprout instantly destroys all of its active hedges, but Sprout will have its Super charged fully again.
Star Powers
Overgrowth
"Every 5.0 seconds, the next Seed Bomb will explode with a larger explosion radius."

Sprout gains a charge bar that takes 5 seconds to fully charge up, and when charged, the next attack’s radius increases by 40%. After the attack is used, Sprout's charge bar resets. Unlike other charging bars, Sprout's Overgrowth's bar starts charging immediately after its last use, and does not require all three ammo to charge. It is very similar to Byron's Injection Star Power's charging bar mechanics.
Photosynthesis
"Sprout activates a shield, partially protecting itself from all attacks while inside a bush."

While in a bush, Sprout shields itself from all damage taken by 30%. After exiting the bush, the shield lasts for another 3 seconds.
Tips

    Sprout's Seed Bombs have a delay while in the air and can bounce uncontrollably. As a result, it’s difficult for Sprout to attack enemies that are close to it unless nearby walls are used to assist them, which will allow Sprout’s attacks to reach enemies easier. However, Sprout has greater damage potential at longer ranges because due to its attack’s bouncing and throwing mechanics, hitting enemies is easier due to the range increase. Because of this, you can utilize auto-aim with Sprout, as the attack can bounce on the ground and off walls.
    Sprout can prevent enemies from escaping the poison clouds with its Super in Showdown/Duo Showdown, potentially knocking enemies out, and Sprout can increase the damage by attacking while the enemy can’t provide counter fire. This is especially useful in Cavern Churn and other maps with an abundance of walls.
    Sprout's Super is effective at blocking off vital choke points and essential areas, effectively leaving only one or two passages for enemies to pass through. This causes them to group together, allowing for an effective team wipe, especially with area attackers on your team such as Jessie.
    In maps with very narrow choke-points like G.G. Mortuary in Heist and Split in Hot Zone, Sprout can use its Hedge along with its Transplant Gadget to almost permanently block those routes, nullifying the enemies from reaching the important area.
    Sprout's Super can also hinder the Siege Robot from reaching the team IKE as long as the barrier lasts. In the Hedge’s duration, it also blocks any non-thrower projectiles or airborne/teleporting Brawlers and it also blocks attacks from melee Brawlers attempting to attack the IKE.
    Sprout’s attack radius can damage multiple enemies, especially if it has its Overgrowth Star Power equipped. Hitting multiple opponents charges its Super faster and deals a lot more damage, despite Sprout’s moderately low damage output, so always take advantage of the situation if enemies group together.
    Sprout's walls can be used to block the ball from being scored in Brawl Ball. Paired with Transplant, Hedge can become an almost-permanent barrier. However, be wary that Hedge can be destroyed with invulnerability shields. <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/c/cf/Squeak_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20210525145828" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Squeak is a Mythic Brawler who has moderate health and damage. He attacks by shooting a blob of goo that sticks to obstacles and targets alike and then explodes after a delay. His Super, Big Blob, shoots a giant ball that explodes into six smaller blobs that each explode after a delay, similar to his main attack. His Gadget, Windup, doubles the range of his next attack. His first Star Power, Chain Reaction, increases his attack's damage for every enemy Brawler inside his attack’s radius. His second Star Power, Super Sticky, slows enemies hit by his Super's secondary blobs.
Attack: Sticky Blomb
"Squeak's sticky blobs of goo are unstable, and blow up with a big splash and an ouch! They attach to any opponent they hit outright, as well as any opponent that strays too near to a blob on the ground."

Squeak attacks by throwing a blob of goo that sticks to obstacles and targets and explodes, damaging anyone in a 2.67 tile radius after a 1.15 second delay, similar to Bo‘s mines. The blobs stop the end of their range and explode regardless of what the blob sticks to. The explosion can damage enemies behind walls, similar to Jacky's attack. These blobs can stack on an obstacle or target until they explode. 
Super: Big Blob
"Squeak lobs a blob that, after a short delay, blows up with aplomb! The explosion of goo sends six smaller Sticky Blombs in all directions."

Squeak throws a giant ball that explodes after 2 seconds, sending out six secondary Sticky Blombs in a hexagon pattern that travel for 6.67 tiles and explode in a 1.33 tile explosion radius. The blobs behave in an identical manner to Squeak's regular Sticky Blombs.
Gadget: Windup
"Squeak's next Sticky Blomb has its range increased by 100%."

When activated, Squeak's next attack has its range doubled to 15.33 tiles. A Gadget symbol will glow above Squeak's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after this attack is shot.
Star Powers:
Chain Reaction
"Each opponent within the area of a Sticky Blomb's explosion increases the Blomb's damage by 10%."

Every enemy Brawler in the range of one of Squeak's attacks will result in 10% linearly increased damage to every target (including spawnables) in the explosion radius. This Star Power still takes effect if there is only one enemy Brawler, giving Squeak at least a permanent 10% extra damage for every attack. Secondary Sticky Blombs from his Super aren’t affected by this Star Power.
Super Sticky
"Secondary Sticky Blomb from Squeak's Super also slow down opponents for 4 seconds."

The secondary Sticky Blombs from Squeak's Super now slow down enemies hit by the explosions for 4 seconds.
Tips

    Squeak's attacks can be used to safeguard specific areas to prevent Brawlers from entering, by shooting his attacks at such areas ensuring that they get damaged by going there. For example, you can throw blombs at Gems in Gem Grab or Bolts in Siege. His attack’s delay coupled with his Super's area denial makes him an ideal control Brawler.
    Squeak is ideal for modes like Heist and Siege because his Super can deal incredible amounts of damage, similar to Spike's attack. Its wide area potential also allows it to sweep bushes, but its delay requires timing skills.
    Squeak is unable to deal immediate burst damage due to his delayed attack and below-average damage, so in Brawl Ball, he struggles to defend his goal and prevent enemies from scoring, not to mention his lack of any abilities that make the enemy drop the Ball, such as knockbacks, pulls, or stuns. If you choose to play Squeak in Brawl Ball, make sure to close off choke points with your lingering attack and stay alive for your team.
    Keep in mind that Squeak's sticky blobs can stick to almost every obstacle and target. This can have plenty of unique and unpredictable outcomes, such as attaching Sticky Blombs to minecarts in Minecart Madness so they travel to enemies and (along with the minecart's 2000 damage) knock them out, should they become trapped, or attaching it to spawnables such as Pam's healing station or 8-BIT’s Damage Booster to prevent enemies from going near them.
    Squeak can be used to discourage enemies from using teleporters. If you see a teleporter light up after its cooldown, try throwing your Sticky Blombs to the teleporter so that enemies take damage the moment they exit it, or avoid teleporting if they know there’s a blob at their destination.
    Squeak's Windup Gadget should be used with care, since the range of the attack makes you unable to see where the attack will hit. However, if you need to quickly deal damage to the IKE turret in Siege, you can utilize this to guarantee a hit on the IKE turret without having to dive in to the IKE’s range. This very useful to gain the lead during the last few seconds of a match.
        Due to the modified attack's long range, you can also use his Windup Gadget to apply pressure on another lane on the map while covering one lane. This is really good in helping your teammates even if you're taking on your own fight.
    Squeak can deal damage to multiple enemies at a time. This is useful in maps with a plethora of walls, where enemies will quite often group up. Since Squeak can hit many enemies, he can charge his Super quicker and weaken the enemy team. His radius also allows him to hit enemies behind walls one tile wide, which can be useful against throwers or anyone else behind.
    Since Squeak has a delayed attack, there is a chance that your opponent could defeat you first, so you should maintain distancing from enemies, especially heavyweights and assassins, who can easily defy the delayed and slow-reloading attack. This still works effectively because Squeak is ideal at keeping control and keeping your opponents away.
    While Squeak's Super can cover a good chunk of the map, the bombs don't have a large range and experienced players can deter it. Aim it like Tick's attack to prevent enemies from entering a point.
    Due to his special attack projectile and the radius of damage, you'll be able to detect bush-camping enemies after you’ve hit them once. After that, you can continue to attack your enemies. However, some high-burst damage brawlers like Spike, Edgar, or Bull could pop out of bushes and eliminate you easily due to Squeak's attack delay, so you need to check bushes more frequently or stay in an open area.
    When playing Squeak in Duo Showdown, keep a teammate with high close-ranged burst damage like Bull to cover up Squeak's weakness at close-quarters combat.
    Squeak’s Chain Reaction Star Power is useful for enemies who are grouped up, which occurs only in certain situations. If you aim your attack correctly towards the grouped-up enemies, it can guarantee an extra 10% damage for each enemy. <br><br><br><br><br>

Tara is a Mythic Brawler with a moderate amount of health and damage. She attacks by throwing three tarot cards that pierce through her enemies and spread out, therefore dealing the most damage at close range. For her Super, she throws a black hole that quickly pulls in enemies within a short range, then explodes, dealing moderate damage. Her first Gadget, Psychic Enhancer, allows Tara and her teammates to see all enemies hiding in bushes. Her second Gadget, Support From Beyond, summons three shadowy figures with low health that chase down and attack enemies. Her first Star Power, Black Portal, causes her Super to summon a shadowy figure that chases down and attacks enemies. Her second Star Power, Healing Shade, also summons a shadowy figure when using her Super, but instead it heals Tara as well as her teammates.

Attack: Triple Tarot
"Tara flicks her wrist, snapping off three tarot cards that pierce through enemies. Quite a trick!"

Tara throws three tarot cards simultaneously that are able to pierce through multiple targets. This attack has a long range, a slight spread, and a relatively slow reload speed. Due to the spread of her attacks, she deals the most damage at close range, though it is relatively easy to hit targets with at least two of the cards even at a range.
Super: Gravity
"Tara conjures up a mind-boggling gravity well! Enemies in the area of effect get pulled in, crashing together painfully hard."

Tara throws a card that becomes a black hole that attracts every enemy within 4 tiles of it for 0.7 seconds. After 1.4 seconds, it will explode, dealing moderately low damage to all enemies caught in the explosion. This also breaks walls.
Gadgets
Psychic Enhancer
"Tara and her allies are able to see all enemies, even inside bushes, for 4.0 seconds."

This Gadget allows Tara, as well as her teammates, to see every enemy Brawler visible on their screen, including those that are inside bushes or invisible, for the next 4 seconds after the gadget's activation. However, if Tara is defeated, the effect ends immediately. If an enemy is being revealed with this Gadget, they will be notified by a small yellow eye icon next to their Brawler's health bar. An eye icon similar to her mechanical eye will appear above Tara's figure during this Gadget's period.
Support from Beyond
"Tara surrounds herself with three weak shadows that attack enemies and disappear after 6 seconds."

When Tara uses this Gadget, she summons three shadowy figures in a triangular formation around her that follow and attack the closest enemy(s). They have 1000 health each and deal 500 damage with a range of 1.67 tiles every 0.6 seconds. These shadows automatically despawn after 6 seconds.
Star Powers
Black Portal
"Tara's Super cracks open a dimensional portal! A shadowy version of Tara appears and attacks her enemies."

When Tara uses her Super, a shadowy, smaller version of herself appears after the Super's explosion. This minion is similar to Nita's bear, but with lower health and higher damage. This minion has 3000 health and deals 800 damage with a range of 1.67 tiles every 0.6 seconds. It has a fast movement speed, allowing it to be an immediate threat to enemy Brawlers.
Healing Shade
"Tara's Super cracks open a dimensional portal! A shadowy version of Tara appears to heal Tara and her teammates."

When Tara uses her Super, a shadowy, smaller figure of herself appears after the Super's explosion. This minion has 2400 health and heals 400 health per 0.6 seconds with a max range of 5 tiles to a single ally nearby. When nobody with missing health is nearby, it will run to the nearest teammate without max health. Note that the shadow only heals the ally that's closest to it, not the ally with the least amount of health.
Tips

    Her main attack can be really useful when many rival Brawlers are gathered in a small area since it not only deals damage to more than one enemy but helps to build up her Super faster.
    When being pursued by fast Brawlers like El Primo or Crow, it is wise to throw Tara's Super behind them, pulling them away from you so that you can escape. If being chased by a low-health Brawler, you can then surprise them by unloading all three of your attacks quickly, as Tara deals reasonably high damage at close range. Don't try this with high health brawlers as Tara does not have enough damage and does not reload fast enough to kill them before they kill you. Instead, chip away at their health from a range, using your Super to pull them near you to finish them off.
    Once Tara's Super is charged, try to pull in as many enemies as possible, attacking them while they are being pulled in. Hitting enough Brawlers allows her to quickly charge another Super.
        Try to use Tara's Super when near teammates to maximize the chance of a team wipe as well. Doing so will open up huge opportunities especially in game modes such as Brawl Ball, Heist, Gem Grab, and Duo Showdown.
    In Showdown, a strategy that can be used is to hide in a bush. After a while, find two enemy Brawlers fighting each other and strike. Use her Super to gather them together and finish them off with her main attack.
    It is crucial to conserve Tara’s ammo before using her Super. Because enemies are drawn towards the middle of her Super, they will not be able to attack for a short period; letting Tara use attacks on her opponents without being attacked. Also, bear in mind that her ammunition reload speed is rather slow, so allow extra time to pass if her ammo is exhausted and she is about to spring an attack.
    Tara can be effective in Brawl Ball if she has her Super after a goal has been scored, as she can take out the whole enemy team when they are clustered together at the start of a round. Her Super can also be used to drag in enemies in front of the enemy goal, potentially destroying enemy cover and setting up an opportunity to score.
    Tara's Super is very useful if paired with other Supers, such as Dynamike's Super, Frank's Super, or Spike's Super. Tara can draw enemies together with her Super so that her teammate can hit multiple enemies with theirs. These combos can deal a massive amount of damage and wipe out the enemy team.
    If there are a cluster of Power Cubes, find a bush nearby and use it as bait. Wait until an enemy comes to collect them, then use Tara's Super to delay them from reaching the Power Cubes. When you collect the Power Cubes, finish them off with her main attack.
    Tara's Black Portal Star Power shadow has very low health, but has a good damage output, can run extremely fast, and can detect Brawlers hiding in bushes, making it more of a scouting tool rather than an offensive Star Power. It can also be a valuable offensive attack on the Heist safe.
    Tara's Healing Shade shadow has very low health, but a decent amount of range and a high amount of healing. As long as enemies are kept away from the shadow, it can provide lots of extra health for your team. However, this might put you at a disadvantage on maps where bush concealment is crucial since the shadow will produce healing effects that reveal your location to enemies.
        If Tara has her Healing Shade Star Power and her teammate(s) are low on health, it's better to throw a portal away from enemies so that Tara's shadow can heal longer. Throwing the portal into a crowd of people is always a great technique, but the shadow will get taken out much faster. Decide how to use her Super based on the situation, if you have this Star Power.
    In Brawl Ball, surprise enemies by using the destruction radius at the center of her Super to break a hole in the wall in most maps. This feature of her Super is especially useful if her teammates are long-ranged Brawlers or Brawlers with high spread, as freeing up the map allows them to control larger areas and be more effective when pressuring the enemy team.
    Tara's Psychic Enhancer Gadget is great in maps with lots of bushes, like Snake Prairie and Cavern Churn. It works better with teammates like Bull, who can creep up on enemies in bushes exposed by Tara’s Gadget whilst being entirely concealed.
    Tara's Support from Beyond Gadget is very useful in Heist. If all three shadows attack, they can deal incredibly high amounts of damage to the safe as long as no other enemy is in range, the shadow summoned from her Black Portal Star Power can add some extra damage.
    You can also use Tara's Support from Beyond Gadget to tank shots from single target brawlers such as Piper or Bea. <br><br><br><br><br>
    LEGENDARY BRAWLERS: <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/a/a3/Amber_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20201108094559" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Amber is a Legendary Brawler that has moderate health and a high damage output. She attacks by shooting a continuous long-ranged stream of fire. For her Super, Amber lobs a flask of fire fluid that creates a flammable puddle on the ground which can be ignited by her attack, and when it’s ignited, it sets enemies within the puddle on fire to burn them over time. Her Gadget, Fire Starters, momentarily increases her movement speed and spills a trail of fire fluid behind her that behaves identically to that of her Super. Amber's first Star Power, Wild Flames, allows for two Super fire puddles to be in effect simultaneously and to passively charge her Super when standing near her fire fluid. Her second Star Power, Scorchin' Siphon, increases her reload speed when she’s near her fire fluid.
Attack: Dragon's Breath
"Amber blows a flaming inferno at her opponents. It looks awesome, but watch out or you'll get seared!"

Amber continuously shoots long-ranged flames from a large ammo bar which pierce through enemies. Each flame is shot at a tenth of a second. If the player taps on the attack joystick, Amber only shoots one flame, and if the player presses and holds on the attack joystick, Amber shoots flames continuously, and the flames are shot in the direction the player aims to or at the nearest enemy if the player doesn’t aim. Amber stops attacking when the player lets go of the joystick or her ammo bar runs out of flames. Her ammo drains when she attacks and she automatically reloads the bar when not attacking.

Super: Torch 'Em!
"Amber throws a flask of her fire fluid that she can then light up with her firebreathing. Bushes and opposing Brawlers will be toast! (One flask at a time!)"

Amber lobs a flask of fire fluid which can be thrown over walls. When it lands, it creates a 2.67 tile radius puddle of dark blue fire fluid. The fluid can be interrupted by lakes, but not walls. The puddle stays indefinitely until it’s ignited by her attack or when another Super is used, and doesn’t affect the enemies regularly. If Amber's attack ignites the fluid, the fluid disappears and burns any enemies and bushes that are in the puddle, causing them to take a high amount of damage over 4 seconds.
Gadget: Fire Starters
"Amber runs fast for 3.0 seconds while spilling her fire fluid, which she can then ignite."

Amber gains a 14% movement speed boost for 3 seconds and spills a trail of fire fluid behind her in the duration, which behaves identically to her Super, as it stays until ignited. Unlike her Super, using her Fire Starters Gadget again doesn’t remove her previous Gadget’s fluid.
Star Powers
Wild Flames
"Amber can have two fuel puddles on the ground simultaneously and she will recharge her Super automatically when standing near one."

Amber can have two fire fluid puddles from her Super, and the first puddle only disappears if a third Super is used. Additionally, whenever she’s standing near a puddle of fluid from either her Super or her Fire Starters Gadget, her Super passively charges 5% per second.
Scorchin' Siphon
"While being near a puddle of fire fluid, Amber uses it to reload her firebreathing 50% faster."

When Amber is standing near a puddle of fire fluid from either her Super or Fire Starters Gadget, she reloads 50% faster and gains a reddish appearance to indicate the Star Power is active. A minimum of 0.67 tiles into the puddle is required to activate the Star Power.
Tips

    Amber is an excellent cover destroyer that can both burn down a large amount of bushes from her fuel puddles and her attack combined while also being able to inflict burn damage and block off essential areas, restricting an enemy's ability to heal and retreat, making her viable in any event. Her techniques are useful in Heist, because she can deal high damage to the safe with her Super, her Fire Starters Gadget, and her attack alike. Along with a Siege Bot to aid her, she can also use these techniques in Siege and deal high or last-minute damage to the IKE.
    Her Super and Fire Starters Gadget can maintain area control and block off choke points, which is vital in Gem Grab and Hot Zone. In these events, she can place her puddle over the Gem mine or zones, therefore scaring enemies out of the Gem mine or zones, and prohibiting the enemies from achieving the respective game objective. She can ignite the puddle if any enemy tries to cross it, dealing significant damage and weakening the enemy. In addition, the puddles from her Super and Fire Starters Gadget can connect to create an extremely large puddle to control massive areas. The puddle’s area control and size are better justified with her Wild Flames Star Power.
    Amber's Wild Flames Star Power and Fire Starters Gadget are extremely useful in helping Amber regain her Super back quickly, mostly when you require a quick Super charge, such as at the beginning of a match. With her Fire Starters Gadget, she can create a large puddle area in which her Super recharges, allowing for an insane pace of Supers while fighting.
    Trails from her Fire Starters Gadget can also be used as firewalls to protect yourself or allies when low on health and retreating from enemy fire. Make sure to keep puddles contained and connected so enemies, especially heavyweights and assassins, are damaged when crossing the puddles. However, airborne Brawlers such as Edgar can jump in, so always maintain a distance from such enemies.
    Be careful about the positioning of Amber’s Super, because if it’s thrown in an undesirable position, you might accidentally ignite it when attacking an enemy near the puddle, so make sure to place the fluid somewhere outside your attacking spot but still in your range so you can ignite the puddle at the right time. This also enables you to control two lanes at once.
    Try and predict the enemy's movement to land more shots, because there’s a minimal yet noticeable delay between aiming and firing. You’ll deal maximum damage by aiming where the enemy is likely to move. Aiming at the enemy’s current position won’t damage the moving enemy, because Amber’s flames travel rather slowly. This is similar to how throwers and sharpshooters with slow unload speeds should predict their attacks.
    Amber is an excellent counter to high-health Brawlers such as Bull, because her continuous attack deals enough damage to eliminate them. She can also use her Super to prevent them from healing and finish them off. However, maintain your distance from these Brawlers because Amber, with her moderate health, can be two or three-shotted by most tanks if they get close enough, and she’s helpless in close-combat due to her inability to deal immediate damage and her lack of disruptive abilities to distance herself from such Brawlers.
    Try not to waste ammo with Amber. If Amber is out of ammo, she needs to wait a while to fully reload, despite what seems to be an incredibly fast reload speed. With her Scorchin' Siphon Star Power, you can mildly overcome this issue by using her Super or her Fire Starters Gadget to reload quicker. That way, you can continue providing fire. <br><br><br><br><br>

Crow is a Legendary Brawler that has low health, a moderately high damage output, and great mobility. He attacks by firing 3 long-ranged daggers that also inflict poison on his enemies. Crow's Super makes him jump and land, throwing daggers radially around him upon take-off and landing. His first Gadget, Defense Booster, grants him a momentary damage-reducing shield. His second Gadget, Slowing Toxin, slows all poisoned enemies for a few seconds. His first Star Power, Extra Toxic, moderately decreases the damage output of a poisoned enemy. His second Star Power, Carrion Crow, adds additional damage to his daggers when an enemy is below 50% health.
Attack: Switchblade
"Crow throws a triple threat of daggers. Enemies hit by the poisoned blades will take damage over time and have all healing effects reduced for the duration."

Crow throws three long-ranged daggers in front of him simultaneously in a slight spread. These daggers damage enemies upon contact, while also inflicting poison to enemies over time. The poison effect damages for 4 ticks/seconds, deals 25% of his basic damage, and prevents the enemy from automatically healing. Regardless of how many times an enemy is hit by Crow's attack, they only take one stack of poison at a time. Poisoned enemies have all healing sources reduced by 40%, but this doesn’t affect Max's Sneaky Sneakers Gadget.

Crow jumps into the air and throws 14 daggers radially that spread out as they travel. He then lands on his aimed destination, firing another set of 14 daggers radially upon landing. If there are lakes, his jump is increased to the nearest ground. The daggers from his Super behave identically to his attack. While in the air, Crow is completely impervious to all damage besides status effects and damage applied over time.

Star Powers
Extra Toxic
"Crow's poison saps the strength of enemies, who deal 25% less damage while poisoned."

Crow's daggers apply an attack debuff, decreasing the damage output of a poisoned enemy by 25%. This affect Star Powers and Gadgets that deal damage, but only affects damage. The effect is lost if the poison effect wears off.
Carrion Crow
"Crow deals +152 damage with his attack and Super to targets with 50% or less health."

If the enemy has less than 50% of their maximum health, Crow deals 152 extra damage with his main attack and Super to the enemy. The poison damage also deals 38 extra damage. In addition, their health bar turns pink instead of the usual red to indicate the bonus is active. The effect is lost if the enemy heals back above 50% health.
Tips

    Due to Crow's fast reload speed and fast unload speed, he can unload his attack relatively frequently. This allows him to constantly apply poison damage on enemies, preventing them from healing and building up his Super all the while.
    His Super is a fitting assassination tool. Once a Brawler has low health due to the poison, he can jump on them for an quick defeat. Because the daggers come out in radial motion, you can position yourself to land onto an enemy Brawler, maximizing the Super's potential. Crow's Super also is a viable escape tool. If he is low on health with Brawlers approaching, you can use his Super to fly away and escape while also poisoning the enemy Brawlers both on take-off and landing. His Defense Booster Gadget enables better survivability while using his Super, and his Slowing Toxin Gadget also prevents enemies from chasing Crow or retreating from Crow’s Super. This works best with close-ranged Brawlers, as they’ll be poisoned and can’t reach him to damage him due to Crow’s relatively long range.
    Crow's poison prevents the poisoned Brawler from self-healing for 4 seconds more than the normal healing time (3 seconds), raising the required time for auto-regeneration to be 7 seconds instead (similar to El Primo‘s El Fuego Star Power) since the poison enables damage for an extended period. This hinders enemies’ abilities to regroup and recover health. The poison damage also causes the Brawler to appear while in bushes, so it also prevents Brawlers inflicted with poison from hiding and healing. For this reason, Crow is a great poker that can finish off low-health enemies or continuously prevent isolated Brawler from healing and force them to retreat.
    To use Crow is to take advantage of his range by poking at the enemy. Attack from a distance and back off to chip away at an enemy's health and charge his Super. While poking, use Crow’s speed to dodge enemy attacks. Although poking deals low damage each time, especially because most long-ranged Brawlers deal more damage at a range, it builds up to high damage, especially with the poison, forcing enemies to retreat.
    Crow's Super can be useful for Brawl Ball. When Crow has the ball and his Super, he can self-pass, by kicking the ball in front of him, and then use his Super to jump past other Brawlers and retrieve the ball, then attempt to score.
    Crow's Extra Toxic reduces damage dealt by poisoned enemies. This also works on IKE turrets, Boss Fight Robots, and Big Game Bosses, making them overall less effective in the long run, and increasing his team's survivability.
    Carrion Crow allows Crow to pick off lower-health targets with ease. Let someone else damage a Brawler to half health, then poke them down until they're finished.
    Whenever playing him on Showdown with the Angry Robo Modifier, it’s not ideal to play solo as Crow can’t deal high damage to the Boss by himself; playing Duo Showdown with a high-damaging teammate is much more ideal.
    An advanced aiming tactic is to try to hit 2 daggers at a medium range away from an enemy, by aiming slightly to the edges. This gets easier the closer an enemy is to him. However, at a certain point it's simply better to quickfire to have all 3 daggers hit a target.
    Both of Crow's Star Powers are strong in modes such as Duo Showdown/Showdown, Bounty/Lone Star, and Knockout. Since surviving while defeating the enemies is the number one priority, Extra Toxic reducing an enemy's damage is a very underestimated and viable tactic. Since Extra Toxic's damage reduction is percentage-based, it also scales with a target's health, giving him a better chance against heavyweights or enemies with a high amount of Power Cubes. Meanwhile, Carrion Crow can be very strong in 1v1 interactions. Early into the game where Power Cubes aren't abundant, Carrion Crow can provide crucial damage required to eliminate an enemy. The Star Power of choice ultimately depends on play style: Extra Toxic is better for a sustained, controlled game of Showdown while Carrion Crow is better for an aggressive play style that capitalizes on early eliminations.
    Defense Booster should be activated after using Crow’s Super to get more value and to be able to play aggressively. Slowing Toxin, however, should be activated right before using Crow’s Super to block mobility to escape from Crow’s Super.
    Keep in mind how many daggers and/or poison damage Crow requires for his Super. Knowing this can help you decide when to jump to eliminate an enemy and whether you should continue pursuing them as your target. <br><br><br><br><br>

Leon is a Legendary Brawler who has moderate health and a high damage output at close range. He attacks by flicking out four Spinner Blades that sweep and deal less damage further away. Leon's Super makes him temporarily invisible. His Gadget, Clone Projector, creates a clone of himself to confuse enemies. His first Star Power, Smoke Trails, increases his movement speed while invisible. His second Star Power, Invisiheal, heals him over time while invisible.
Attack: Spinner Blades
"Leon flicks his wrist and fires four Spinner Blades. The blades deal less damage the farther they travel."

Leon fires 4 long-ranged blades that sweep from left to right in a cone. The damage dealt depends on how far they travel before hitting their targets. Targets close to Leon take the most damage, and targets at a distance take significantly less damage. The attack takes 0.55 seconds to complete.

Super: Smoke Bomb
"Leon becomes invisible for 6 seconds. If he attacks, he will be revealed. Enemies close to Leon will be able to spot him."

Leon turns himself invisible for 6 seconds, allowing him to either retreat or ambush an enemy. Enemy Brawlers can see him if he is within 4 tiles of them. If Leon attacks while invisible, he loses his invisibility. If he takes damage during his Super, he will be visible for a split second. Note that unlike most Brawlers, Leon's Super charges based on damage dealt rather than number of projectiles hit. Using his Super cancels auto-regeneration.

Picking up items (like Gems in Gem Grab, Power Cubes in Showdown, or Bolts in Siege) or holding the Ball in Brawl Ball or the trophy in Trophy Thieves while invisible makes him visible. Enemy minions (such as Nita's bear) can’t locate him while invisible, but allied minions (such as Tara's Healing Shade) can still detect Leon while invisible. Knockbacks and stuns don’t affect the Super, only Leon himself.
Gadget: Clone Projector
"Leon creates an illusion of himself to confuse his enemies."

Leon creates a clone of himself, which allows him to confuse enemies or to escape. The clone chases down the nearest enemy but won’t do anything when it reaches the enemy. It uses Leon's health at the Gadget’s activation time and copies the number of items (such as the number of Gems, etc.) that Leon himself has, as well as the status of his Super. However, the clone can’t heal and the damage dealt to it is doubled. The clone vanishes when defeated, if Leon summons another one, and after 10 seconds. When used in Big Game as the Boss, it displays the same amount of health as Leon himself.
Star Powers
Smoke Trails
"When Leon uses his Super, he gains a 30% boost to his movement speed for the duration of his invisibility."

Leon's movement speed is increased by 30% while his Super is active, allowing him to move much faster while he is invisible.
Invisiheal
"Leon recovers 1000 health per second while his Super is active."

If Leon has missing health while using his Super, he regains 1000 health every second for the duration of his Super, for up to a total of 6000 health if he doesn’t cancel his Super with an attack. He still heals even if he takes damage.
Tips

    Leon's very fast movement speed can be useful good for escaping from enemies, as he’s generally faster than most other Brawlers since he’s an assassin.
    Leon can deal high damage if he hits all of his blades in his attack at short-range. Utilize obstacles to get as close as possible to enemies and unleash your attack that has the potential to defeat all but heavyweights.
    If you're stuck at long range, you can use the strafing technique to still achieve high damage. Similar to Bo, Leon's projectiles are fired one by one from the left to the right, so you can concentrate or spread out by strafing left or right while attacking: You can walk left while shooting to narrow his attack width and increase his damage. The inverse of this also works; you can walk right while attacking to get a wide attack with minor damage for finishing off your enemies.
    With his Super, Leon can effectively ambush Brawlers better than with being advantageous with obstacles. Use it wisely to rush Brawlers and catch them off-guard.
    In Heist, Leon's Super allows him to sneak behind the enemies to attack the enemy safe on the other side of the map.
    Leon is decent in Bounty. His Super allows him to pick off enemies and defeat them one by one, racking up huge amounts of stars for his team.
    Leon's Super is ineffective when used near an enemy when they know your path. Using his Super when hiding in bushes can make your escape route increasingly unpredictable; by doing this, enemies have a hard time finding him after firing at the now unoccupied bushes.
    You can flash your Super as you walk into a bush to trick your enemies into thinking that you’ve gone invisible. This allows you to heal up in the bush whilst your enemies scan the arena, thereby wasting their ammo.
    Leon's blades have a deceptively long range and a spread that widens as they travel. Chip away at enemies and build up your Super before slipping into stealth to defeat Brawlers at close range. This strategy works well in events where one’s intent is to eliminate enemies, such as Bounty, Showdown, Lone Star, or Knockout.
    Conserving ammo is also particularly more important with Leon. His relatively slow reload speed makes him vulnerable to an enemy who has managed to dodge and/or survive Leon's attacks.
    Both of Leon's Star Powers are really useful for Brawl Ball. Smoke Trails allows him to snatch the Ball quickly while enemies are unsuspecting of Leon's presence until Leon retrieved the Ball and attempts to score. Invisiheal can grant Leon an exceptional survivability boost which allows him to withstand much more damage from multiple enemy defenders who are present at their goal.
    Unlike most "assassins," Leon is used for eliminating one enemy at a time and does not have the potential for multi-defeats because of his slow reload and non-piercing attack.
    In Showdown, Leon has two options for play styles: one is a Roamer and the other is a Third Party. Roamers (like Crow, Darryl, etc.) walk around the map searching for potential targets to pick them off one by one. Third Parties (like Mortis or Crow) search for two people who are already engaged in combat and wait (preferably in a nearby bush) till one of the two is defeated. The Third Party then finishes off the winning Brawler and collects both Power Cube batches.
    Leon's Smoke Trails grants him the second-fastest movement speed in the game for the Super’s duration, making him incredibly hard to hit. This is also useful for making quick getaways or to engage someone faster.
    Leon's Invisiheal heals him for 1000 health every second for 6 seconds (unless you attack before the Super's duration ends, which is not recommended with this Star Power), which effectively gives him 6000 additional health. This is preferable over Smoke Trails in-game modes like Gem Grab, Showdown, and Siege, where Leon might need to collect powerups or objectives while staying invisible and also healing if detected. Invisiheal also allows you to dodge meteors or other potentially deadly threats in Showdown. When using Leon's Invisiheal Star Power, try activating his Super right before an engagement. Waiting to attack once in close proximity using your Super while the enemy unloads their shots and while you heal for 1000 health per second gives Leon the ammo and health advantage to win more battles in close quarters.
    Leon's Super can be used both offensively and defensively. If you’re in a bad position, you can use your Super to sneak away from the enemy or even defeat one of them. If you are carrying a lot of Gems in Gem Grab or have a high bounty in Bounty, use your invisibility to escape, making it hard for the opposition to attack you.
    Leon can use his invisibility in maps with launch pads to trick enemies that you've been launched.
    Leon's Clone Projector Gadget can prove to be incredibly useful in some situations, i.e. against a Shelly or Colt with his/her Super. They’ll probably fire their Super at the clone, effectively wasting it. Don’t try this when on low health, because your clone replicates the amount of health you have and the fact that it's charging at a person gives it away. A strategy you can do with it is to go into a bush, pop your Gadget, and then turn invisible for an ambush to finish off low-health Brawlers who will probably waste their ammo on your clone. Leon's Clone Projector can also chase the closest enemy even when they’re inside a bush, letting Leon detect if the bushes have enemies. It can also be used as a meat shield to absorb damage from enemies with a non-piercing, bouncing, or splitting attack.
    If necessary to step into the poison gas in Showdown, you can quickly escape a close fight using Leon’s Invisiheal Star Power. His healing while invisible will contradict the same damage taken by the gas, so you will be able to withstand the damage for a few seconds. Please note after the 5th tick of damage, the damage scales, so you will have to leave the gas (also regarding that Leon's Invisiheal only heals for six ticks of 1000 health).
    His Star Powers are good for different situations. That means that if it’s a passive mode where you’ll have to stay, you must use Invisiheal, and for going somewhere or escaping, use Smoke Trails.
    If you ever use Leon’s Super out in the open, use it while walking one way and immediately turn around and sneak up from another side. This makes it less predictable in where you’ll come from. <br><br><br><br><br>

Sandy is a Legendary Brawler with above-average health, a fast movement speed, and immense utility with his Super, but a below-average damage output. He attacks by throwing sand in a wide spread. His Super summons a sandstorm that grants him and his allies invisibility while inside it. His first Gadget, Sleep Stimulator, makes Sandy fall asleep momentarily to restore missing health. His second Gadget, Sweet Dreams, makes his next attack lull enemies to sleep but the enemies will wake up from any damage. His first Star Power, Rude Sands, allows his Super to deal minor damage to enemies over time when they’re inside the sandstorm. His second Star Power, Healing Winds, allows his Super to slightly heal him and his allies over time when inside the sandstorm.

Attack: Pebble Blast
"Sandy pelts enemies with sharp, piercing pebbles. Ouch!"

Sandy attacks by throwing sand at his enemies that spreads in a cone formation and pierces multiple enemies, dealing moderate damage. The attack consists of 3 groups of sand thrown simultaneously, and the group of sand to the left relative to Sandy has the fastest projectile speed. From left to right, each group of sand decelerates in speed. Only one group of sand can deal damage to an enemy.
Super: Sandstorm
"Sandy summons a sandstorm that lasts for 9 seconds and hides friendly Brawlers inside it."

Sandy throws a star-shaped object and creates a sandstorm in a large radius that lasts for 9 seconds and makes him and his allies invisible. Like Leon's Super, invisible Brawlers are visible to nearby enemies within 4 tiles. Spawnables such as Nita's Bear and Jessie's turret won’t be concealed.

Brawlers carrying the Ball in Brawl Ball or a trophy in Trophy Thieves are still visible. Invisible Brawlers are still visible to the Siege Bot and the IKE turret in Siege. Robots in certain events and Modifiers such as Robo Rumble, Boss Fight, and the Angry Robo Modifier are still able to see players through the sandstorm.
Gadgets
Sleep Stimulator
"Sandy falls asleep for 2.0 seconds and his health is fully restored."

Sandy's Gadget immobilizes him for 2 seconds, but afterwards his health is fully restored. This Gadget can’t be activated if Sandy is already at full health. Sandy can still take damage and be defeated while the Gadget is active. The Gadget can be interrupted by knockbacks, pulls, and stuns. If Sandy is the Big Brawler in Big Game, he only heals 10% of his maximum health. Sleep Stimulator is affected by healing debuffs such as Crow's poison and Byron's Malaise Star Power.
Sweet Dreams
"Sandy's next attack lulls opponents to sleep for 1.5 seconds. They will however wake up from any damage."

When Sandy activates this Gadget, his next attack stuns enemies for 1.5 seconds. However, if they’re damaged by any source in the stun duration, the stun is cancelled. A Gadget symbol will glow above Sandy's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after this attack is shot.
Star Powers
Rude Sands
"Sandstorm now also damages enemies for 100 damage per second."

Sandy's sandstorm now deals 100 damage per second to enemies inside the sandstorm, for a total of up to 900 damage over 9 seconds. This effect can stack with other sandstorms should Sandy charge another Super before the first one ends.
Healing Winds
"Sandstorm now also heals friendly Brawlers for 300 health per second."

Sandy’s sandstorm now heals Sandy and his allies for 300 health per second, for a total of up to 2700 health over 9 seconds. This effect can stack with other sandstorms should Sandy charge another Super before the first one ends.
Tips

    When using Sandy's Super, you should place the sandstorm so that it touches the edges of bushes. This allows you and your teammates to use the sandstorm to head into bushes and access larger areas while the enemies believe you and your allies are still inside the sandstorm.
    Sandy's wide and piercing attack makes it very effective against grouped-up enemies. Use this to your advantage to charge your Super quicker.
    You can use Sandy’s sandstorm to hide low-health and retreating teammates or yourself when you’re low on health and retreating or to hide from enemies to flank them and ally close-ranged Brawlers to ambush enemies scouting the sandstorm. Sandy's Super is very effective in 3v3 modes, because teammates can be positioned stationary while in the vicinity of his Super. His Super allows him and his allies to reach the event objective, whether it’s collecting Bolts in Siege, collecting Gems in Gem Grab, capturing a zone in Hot Zone, hiding from Hunters as the Boss or sneaking up on the Boss as the Hunters in Big Game, and damaging the safe in Heist.
    Sandy's is useful in Heist and Siege because of his Super, but Sandy isn’t too viable in Heist due to his rather minor damage output. Sandy’s Star Powers can be used on offense or defense in these events. You can either use Rude Sands to damage the safe/IKE along with you and your allies attacking, or you can use Healing Winds to heal your teammates while attacking because enemies will be attempting to stop you from attacking, and healing is especially useful in Siege because the IKE turret will continuously attack your team. In addition, in Siege, due to Sandy’s above-average movement speed and health, he’s ideal for obtaining Bolts. You can also use Bolts as bait for close-ranged Brawlers who can stand in his sandstorm near a Bolt, in which they’re invisible, and defeat an enemy who attempts to retrieve the Bolt.
    In Brawl Ball, you can use Sandy's Super to cover the Ball’s vicinity. Use the Ball as bait and if an enemy attempts to retrieve it, a close-ranged Brawler such as Bull could defeat them. After they are defeated, use the time to allow a fast Brawler or self-passer such as Leon, Stu, Edgar, Colt with Slick Boots, or Crow to kick the Ball to the goal. In addition, Sandy has above-average movement speed, therefore making Sandy an ideal Ball carrier.
    Sandy's Rude Sands Star Power can be used for area control, and while the damage over time is minor, the large radius and long duration prevents healing and can slowly drain the enemies' health if they enter the sandstorm and the area it’s placed on, allowing you and your teammates to possibly defeat them or force the enemy to stay far from the area, which is very effective for area control-based events such as Gem Grab and Hot Zone. Sandy's Rude Sands Star Power also counters other Sandy's Supers. If you throw your Super onto their Super, the damage ticks make enemies visible, similar to Crow's poison. This makes it much easier for your team to fight against the opposing Sandy. Sandy's Rude Sands Star Power can also be used in maps with an abundance of bushes such as Snake Prairie or NruhC nrevaC to detect bush-camping enemies.
    Sandy’s Sleep Stimulator Gadget should be used behind obstacles, in bushes, or around corners to avoid being defeated by enemies since Sandy is vulnerable to damage in this state. Using the Gadget in a sandstorm is also very effective as long as there aren’t any enemies scouting the sandstorm.
    Sandy's attack consists of 3 groups of sand that travel at different speeds. The group of sand farthest left relative to Sandy travels the fastest, and each group heading right decelerates in its speed. As a result, aiming slightly left of the enemy can ensure you dealing maximum damage even at maximum range, because the group of sand can reach the enemy before they can escape. This is important to know when utilizing Sandy's wall peek, because you can often clip an enemy hiding behind another enemy by attacking slightly left. <br><br><br><br><br>

His Super lobs a thorny projectile, slowing down and dealing damage to enemies caught in its area-of-effect. His first Gadget, Popping Pincushion, rapidly fires waves of spikes in all directions around him. His second Gadget, Life Plant spawns a cactus to provide cover for him and his teammates, and heals them when the cactus is destroyed. His first Star Power, Fertilize, allows him to heal himself over time when he is inside his Super’s area-of-effect. His second Star Power, Curveball, causes the spikes shot out from his attack to curve in a circular motion.
Attack: Needle Grenade
"Spike fires off a small cactus that explodes, shooting spikes in different directions."

Spike throws a cactus that, upon impact with something or reaching its maximum range, explodes and sends out 6 spikes radially that deal damage. The pattern is fixed, with 60 degrees between each spike, and it doesn’t rotate with the projectile's angle. The projectile does more damage upon contact than the spikes would, and it deals more damage at close range than at long range.

Popping Pincushion
"Spike shoots 3 waves of needles in all directions, dealing 520 damage per hit."

Spike shoots 10 needles in all directions per wave, and each needle deals 520 damage to enemies. These spikes aren’t affected by his Curveball Star Power and travel 6.67 tiles before disappearing.
Life Plant
"Spike grows a large cactus with 3500 health to give cover to friendlies. If destroyed, the cactus bursts, and all nearby friendlies recover 1000 health."

Spike summons a large cactus-shaped plant that has 3500 health. If the plant is destroyed, the plant bursts and heals all allies for 1000 health. This Gadget is affected by the Fertilize Star Power.
Star Powers
Fertilize
"After using Super, Spike regenerates 800 health per second by staying in its area of effect."

This allows Spike to regain 800 health per second by standing in his Super’s area-of-effect. This doesn't affect friendly Brawlers.
Curveball
"Spikes from the cactus grenade fly in a curving motion, making it easier to hit targets."

The spikes thrown from his main attack now move in a curving clockwise motion instead of straight out, allowing Spike's attack to cover a larger area and ultimately hit more Brawlers with his attack. This Star Power also effectively increases the range of the spikes. Curveball doesn’t affect Popping Pincushion.
Tips

    Spike has low health, so practice shooting around obstacles and predicting the enemy’s movement to prevent opportunities for the enemies to damage you. However, his high damage output compensates for it.
    Spike has a very high-damaging attack. One of the few ways to deal that maximum damage is to be at point-blank range from the enemy. He can also use his Popping Pincushion Gadget, in which the spikes also work best at close-range. This makes him a great counter against heavyweights like El Primo and assassins like Mortis who need to get close to him in order to damage him.
    The 6 spikes in his attack always spread out in the same pattern, at 60-degree angles, no matter your position or rotation. You can use this to know where the spikes will land, making it easier to hit enemies around corners and obstacles. Because of this, having the cactus explode near a target is vital because this increases the chances of multiple spikes hitting the same target.
    Since Spike's needles can go all over the place (especially with Curveball), you can use some of those needles to check bushes for hidden enemies.
    Spike is capable of doing extremely high damage to grouped-up enemies due to the multiple spikes shot out from his attack on impact. His area-of-effect Super can also spell trouble for grouped-up enemies, because they can’t escape from Spike’s attack or Popping Pincushion Gadget.
    Spike's Super is a great tool for area control. If the enemy team is trying to escape with the Gems in Gem Grab or trying to score a goal in Brawl Ball, you can slow their escape with your Super.
    Spike's Fertilize is a great healing tool if your team has no support Brawlers. If you find yourself charging your Super too often, don’t hesitate to use it on yourself to heal you fully while you keep attacking enemies. This is also useful in Showdown when closing in on a target with a high damage output, such as Bull. When defending a critical objective or controlling an area, Spike may also use Fertilize in order for area control, slowing and damaging enemies while healing himself. This tactic also works in self-defense, especially in Showdown when being ambushed or pinched.
    If Spike gets close enough to the safe in Heist in such a way that his hitbox aligns itself to the hitbox of the safe, he can deal extremely high damage to the safe with his Popping Pincushion Gadget. This along with his high-damaging attack and his Super’s high damage make him an ideal choice in Heist. Popping Pincushion also serves as a fourth attack while Spike slowly reloads, during defense. <br><br><br><br><br>
CHROMATIC BRAWLERS: <br><br><br><br><br>

Belle is a Chromatic Brawler who could be unlocked as a Brawl Pass reward at Tier 30 in Season 6: The Goldarm Gang, or can be obtained from boxes after reaching Tier 30 in the Season 6 Brawl Pass. She has a moderately high overall damage output with a fast reload speed, but low health. Her attacks are very long-ranged electric bolts that bounce between enemies nearby. Her Super fires a low-damaging marker onto an enemy that boosts any damage towards that enemy until they’re defeated or she uses her Super on someone else. Her Gadget, Nest Egg, drops an invisible trap that deals damage and briefly slows enemies that trigger it. Her first Star Power, Positive Feedback, grants her a brief shield whenever she hits an enemy with her attack. Her second Star Power, Grounded, temporarily disables enemies from reloading when hit by Belle’s Super.

Attack: Shocker
"Belle shoots a long range Electro-Bolt, dealing damage to any target hit. After a short delay, the bolt will jump to any nearby target, deal damage and jump to the next one."

Belle fires a very long-ranged attack that bounces from multiple enemies who are within 3 tiles of each other, until the targets are too far from each other, one is defeated, or they bounce 3 times. Enemies only bounce one attack to each other at a time regardless if hit multiple times from separate attacks or not. The bolts have a one-second delay of sticking to the target before they bounce, with subsequent shots dealing half the damage of the initial shot and super charge. There is an attack cooldown of 0.5 seconds.
Super: Spotter
"Belle fires a spotting shot that marks any opponent it hits. The marked opponent takes extra damage from any source. Only one target can be marked at a time."

Belle's Super is a ranged attack that deals minor damage to the enemy and marks it, making the enemy thereafter take 35% extra damage from any source until they are defeated or Belle uses her Super on someone else. Only one enemy can have this status effect from each Belle. The Super's effect won’t work on immobile targets like Heist safes or Siege IKEs, but can still work on the Siege Bots. It stacks on top of other damage boosting effects, acting as a reverse shield that applies multiplicatively to other multipliers, but does not stack with Supers from other Belles. The marker isn't visible when the target is in bushes.
Gadget: Nest Egg
"Belle places a trap on the ground that will explode when triggered by an opponent. The trap deals 500 damage, and slows down anyone within it's blast radius for 3 seconds."

Belle deploys a trap that is visible for a second after it’s placed before becoming invisible, similar to Bo’s mines. The traps remain on the map until triggered by enemies walking over it. Multiple traps can be placed on the map without one of them disappearing. When triggered, it will immediately deal 500 damage to the victim and other enemies within its 3 tile radius and slow them down for 3 seconds.
Star Powers
Positive Feedback
"Belle gains a 25% shield whenever her Electro-Bolts hit a target."

Every time Belle hits an enemy with her main attack, she will receive a shield that reduces all damage she takes by 25% for 3 seconds. This applies to the subsequent bounce shots and the duration doesn’t stack but resets.
Grounded
"Getting marked by Belle's Super prevents the target from reloading for 3 seconds."

When Belle uses her Super to mark an enemy Brawler, the marked enemy’s attacks will stop reloading for 3 seconds. They can still attack if they have remaining ammo, but this disables Carl from attacking. Even if Belle fires another Super onto another enemy Brawler before the 3 seconds are up, the initial target will still be unable to reload. This Star Power does not affect non-Brawler entities, such as spawnables or the Boss in Boss Fight.
Tips

    Belle's Super can be incredibly powerful on modes such as Boss Fight, Super City Rampage, or Big Game as it will highly increase your whole parties damage against the boss. Always take advantage of grouped-up enemies, boxes, or spawns. Belle can also use her Nest Egg Gadget to keep enemies close enough for her attack to bounce more.
    The boosted damage on enemies hit by Belle's Super makes her an ideal counter to tanks. The damage boost will allow her teammates and her to deal enough damage to kill tanks. This also works to get rid of Brawlers with a very high amount of Power Cubes in Showdown, who can prove challenging to defeat in the later stages of the game where she is limited by poison clouds to maintain her distance from enemies.
    Her Positive Feedback Star Power's duration does not stack, so conserving shots is better to prolong the shield. The 25% shield gives her health equivalent to Colette, and since she doesn't have a guaranteed way to push away rushing Brawlers, conserving shots to prolong the shield gives you a better chance of surviving.
    The shield Belle gets from her Positive Feedback Star Power and the extra damage she can deal with her Super makes her very good for 1v1 interactions as her survivability is increased while the enemy's is decreased.
    Belle's low health means that getting close to enemies is not a viable option, similar to Piper. However, unlike Piper, who has her Super to escape from close-range Brawlers, Belle doesn't have much to defend herself at close range, so she’s vulnerable to heavyweights or assassins. If you're running away from such a Brawler, you can lay your Nest Egg Gadget behind you to deter them from reaching you as disarming the Gadget is not possible without getting slowed. Additionally, if you have her Super charged, you can fire her Super onto the enemy so they receive more damage, and with her Grounded Star Power, momentarily disarms them. If you don’t have her Nest Egg Gadget or your Super charged up, try to predict where the heavyweight or assassin will go, and stay mobile to ensure they can’t reach you.
    Her Nest Egg Gadget is great to trap choke-points on maps such as Cavern Churn, Ice Fort, Hot Maze, or Acid Lakes as it can force Brawlers to walk over her traps, giving the opportunity for a good ambush. Belle's Nest Egg Gadget can also be used for maximum effect in Hot Zone, where it can be used to maintain zone control by trapping it and make enemies vulnerable to being slowed and being killed by allies. Enemies that aren’t tanks or assassins or don’t have traveling abilities cannot travel around it and will have to step on them, making ambushes almost guaranteed.
    Belle has one of the longest consistent ranges in the game. You can use this to your advantage to keep your distance and poke at Brawlers. Because of the bouncing, enemies are forced to separate and you and/or your team can trap and kill them individually, leading the enemies into an uncomfortable situation and position. Her passive chaining bolts and their bounces force enemies to distance themselves, making them vulnerable to assassins who can pick them off individually. This allows her to combo well with assassin Brawlers like Edgar.
    Belle's Super and Nest Egg Gadget is very useful in Siege by utilizing them on the enemy Siege Robot, making your IKE turret and teammates deal more damage to it, and preventing it from reaching the team IKE.
    Belle is a good Brawler on the Showdown maps with the Angry Robo Modifier. She can attack the robot if its following a Brawler and the attack keeps bouncing between the robot and the Brawler, thus causing the Brawler to have less health or even get defeated. It’s less effective against Brawlers with traveling abilities like Carl, Edgar, or Darryl who can escape.
    Belle is also extremely useful in Boss Fight, as she can use her Super to mark the boss early on in the game to help you and your team significantly when taking out the boss. <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/6/62/Buzz_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20210615131438" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Buzz is a Chromatic Brawler who can be unlocked as a Brawl Pass reward at Tier 30 in Season 7: Jurassic Splash, or can be obtained from boxes after reaching Tier 30 in the Season 7 Brawl Pass. He has moderate-high health, a high damage output, and mobility with his Super. His Trait allows Buzz to charge his Super automatically if an enemy is within range of him. His attack is a close-ranged flurry of whistle punches, and his Super throws a buoy towards an enemy or a wall and pulls Buzz towards it, which stuns enemies after pulling himself. His Gadget, Reserve Buoy, instantly and fully charges his Super, but the next Super he uses won’t stun enemies. His Star Power, Tougher Torpedo, increases the stun duration of his Super.
Trait
"This Brawler charges Super from staying close to opposing enemies."

All applicable enemies within 6 tiles of Buzz charge his Super by 6.67% per second or roughly over 15 seconds. He charges his Super faster if there are multiple enemies inside the radius. If there are hidden enemies, (e.g. invisible enemies, enemies hiding in bushes), it still charges.
Attack: Buzz Off
"Buzz throws five quick slaps in an arc."

Buzz attacks with 5 piercing punches from his whistle. Much like Bo, he throws his punches in a strafing motion from left to right. This attack takes 0.9 seconds to complete.
Super: Torpedo Throw
"Buzz throws out his torpedo buoy. If it hits an opponent or a wall, Buzz hauls himself over there, stunning nearby opponents where he lands."

Buzz throws out a buoy that can hit both enemies or walls, pulling himself to the target afterwards. When Buzz lands on an enemy, he stuns them and nearby in a 2.33 tile radius. The stun duration is based on how far Buzz used his Super on the enemy before getting on them. The farther away Buzz was before hitting a target with his Super, the longer the stun duration. The maximum stun duration is 1.5 seconds and the minimum is 0.5 seconds. If Buzz moves behind a wall while firing his Super, he goes through the wall. If Buzz's Super latches on an enemy and that enemy moves away from where they were initially hit, Buzz will be pulled to the enemy's new location, even if they move behind a wall. Buzz can travel across lakes while being pulled, he can still move before the buoy hits an enemy or wall, and if a wall gets destroyed while Buzz pulls himself, he’ll be pulled to the location where the buoy hit. However, Buzz’s Super can be interrupted if he’s pulled, stunned, or knocked back while using his Super.
Gadget: Reserve Buoy
"Instantly fills the Super meter, but the next Torpedo Throw doesn't stun opponents."

When Buzz activates this Gadget, he charges his Super completely, but his next Super won’t stun enemies. Buzz can’t use this Gadget if his Super is already charged, and if he gets defeated before he uses that Super, Buzz will respawn without a full Super. A Gadget symbol will glow above Buzz's head signaling this Gadget's usage, as well as a glowing Super joystick. This Gadget's cooldown starts after using his Super.
Star Power: Tougher Torpedo
"The minimum duration of Buzz's Super stun is increased by 0.5 seconds."

The minimum stun duration of his Super is increased to 1 second, instead of the usual 0.5 seconds. This Star Power doesn’t affect his Reserve Buoy Gadget or the maximum stun duration of his Super.
Tips

    In order to hit all 5 shots, Buzz must either move clockwise around the enemy or attack at point-blank range. The latter, while easier to do, is more risky due to some Brawlers excelling at point-blank range combat, including Darryl, Spike, Shelly and Bull.
    Since Buzz’s attack is short-ranged, only engage an enemy without a Super if he can actually land his attack. If there aren’t any nearby enemies to charge your Super passively, use obstacles to get closer to enemies instead.
    If an enemy is escaping and out of Buzz's range, he can use his Super to quickly catch up and stun the enemy, giving the chance for Buzz to finish them off.
    Buzz isn’t immune to damage when he is traveling to a grappled Brawler, so grappling one while Buzz is at low health is risky.
    Since Buzz's Super stuns in a short radius around him when he finishes traveling to where his buoy lands, so it’s simple to grapple an obstacle next to an enemy to stun them rather than grapple the enemy themselves.
    Buzz's Reserve Buoy Gadget can be used for emergency situations like escaping without having a Super charged yet. It can also be used offensively by using it as a second Super to catch up to enemies faster or as a Super at the beginning of a match.
    His Trait charges his Super in 15 seconds with an enemy in the radius. If you are in the beginning of a match and grappling the enemy with your Reserve Buoy Gadget might not be enough to secure a defeat, you can simply play passive around obstacles and wait for your Super to charge.
    Since his Trait still charges his Super on non-visible enemies, he can use it as a scouting tool for bush-filled areas or maps like Snake Prairie, His Eyes Sharp Star Power makes him even better at scouting for enemies because it extends his Super-charging radius, allowing him to better scout bush-camping or invisible enemies. He isn’t ideal as a scouting Brawler over much better scouting Brawlers such as Bo or Tara.
    If you are facing aggressive Brawlers and the extra Super-charging range from his Trait isn’t necessary, it could be worth it to use his Tougher Torpedo Star Power to get a boost in the stun duration at close range and ensure knocking them out.
    Buzz can stun the whole enemy team if they’re grouped up and defeat all of them with his widespread attack. His slow unload speed makes him especially vulnerable after his second attack but another Super allows him to knock them out. <br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/brawlstars/images/6/63/Colette_Skin-Default.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/274?cb=20201113164723" alt=""><br><br><br><br><br>
Colette is a Chromatic Brawler that could be unlocked as a Brawl Pass reward at Tier 30 from Season 3: Welcome to Starr Park! or can be unlocked from Brawl Boxes. She attacks by firing a projectile that deals more damage the more health her enemy has or a fixed amount against certain targets. For her Super, she dashes forwards and then back very quickly, damaging any enemies in her path based on their maximum health. Her Gadget, Na-ah!, makes her next shot deal an additional 1000 damage. Her first Star Power, Push It, pushes Brawlers caught in her Super to its furthest point which stuns them until Colette turns back. Her second Star Power, Mass Tax, gives her a initial temporary shield when using her Super that increases the damage reduction for every enemy hit by the Super.
Attack: Taxing Shot
"Colette fires a shot that takes what you owe! And the more you have, the more you owe."

Colette fires a heart-shaped projectile at long range, dealing 37% of the opponent's current health; thus she can do a large amount of damage to high-health targets such as Frank and El Primo but low damage to low-health targets like Piper or Tick. Power Cube buffs are applied after the base damage is calculated. The attack has a minimum damage amount, which increases based on Colette's power level. Colette's attack will deal the minimum damage amount once 37% of the enemy's health is lower than her minimum damage.

For special targets (such as Power Cube Boxes, the IKE, Heist Safes, spawnables, Big Brawlers in Big Game or other non-Brawlers), she will deal a fixed amount of damage that is based on her power level instead.
Super: Time To Collect
"Colette makes a dash forth and back, dealing taxing damage to everyone in her path, based on their maximum health."

Colette dashes forward a long distance until she reaches maximum range or is blocked by a wall, and then dashes back to her starting position. She can go over water while using her Super. If she collides with an enemy, she deals 20% of the target's maximum health, both on her forward and on her return dash. Similar to her main attack, Power Cube buffs are applied after the base damage is calculated, and she will do twice as much damage to special targets as her main attack.
Gadget: Na-ah!
"Colette's next shot deals extra 1000 damage."

Upon activation, Colette's next attack deals 1000 more damage. A Gadget symbol will glow above Colette's head signaling this Gadget's activation, as well as a glowing attack joystick. This Gadget's cool-down begins after the attack is used.
Star Powers
Push It
"All enemy Brawlers hit by Colette's charge are carried to the farthest point of the attack!"

When using her Super, Colette drags enemies she hits to the maximum range of her Super. This will interrupt any attacks and Supers, such as Carl's or Frank's Super. Brawlers affected by this Star Power can be pushed across water as well. Brawlers carried to the farthest point of the attack will be hit twice.
Mass Tax
"Colette's Super gives her a 20% shield for 5.0 seconds. Every enemy Brawler hit by it will add 10% more protection."

When using her Super, she will get an initial 20% damage reduction shield that increases by 10% with every enemy she hits, and the shield lasts for 5 seconds after using the Super. This can allow her to have a 100% damage reduction (immunity) if she hits 8 or more enemies with her Super. Note that even with the 100% shield, it will not affect slows, stuns, or knock backs.
Tips

    Colette is a fighter that specializes as a tank-counter. Her attacks can cut massive amounts of health, but without proper support and understanding of her abilities, she struggles to take enemies out in a short amount of time. Therefore, she synergizes with assassins like Crow as she can quickly bring enemies to low health and allow the assassins to finish them off.
    If she hits two quick shots and a Super, Colette can defeat every Brawler in the game provided that they do not have any shields or passive healing abilities. This tactic makes Colette a very effective tank counter. Her Super has a quick charging rate along with her attack, meaning that she can do this multiple times. This can be aided with her Mass Tax Star Power, which protects her as she charges.
    Colette's Super can be used to collect gems and return to cover, making her a good last-resort gem carrier in Gem Grab if your primary gem carrier falls. Her Super can also be used to collect Power Cubes in Showdown or Bolts in Siege.
    Colette with her Super is capable of team-wiping. Her Super's large width can hit multiple enemies, and if she hits two Brawlers both when dashing forward and dashing back, she immediately charges another Super, effectively allowing her to use her Super again for massive amounts of damage.
    Colette's Push It Star Power can be used like Gale's Super. In 3v3 modes, it can be used to either interrupt a Brawler's Super, like Frank's, or to push them away to help buy teammates some time to gain control of the middle. Another use is to remove the ball from someone in Brawl Ball. She can also push Brawlers into the gas or meteors in Showdown, though you should be more careful about running into the gas if you don't have Mass Tax, and should time your Super well if you are about to run into a meteor.
    In Solo Showdown, use Colette’s range to chip away at enemy Brawlers from a distance. Once you fully charge your Super, you are able to dash in for the kill when appropriate. Be mindful about how the enemy can counter your two shots + Super combo, such as shields, healing, or debuffs.
    Colette thrives off of understanding her combos and interactions. As mentioned before, Colette is strongest when the user utilizes the two shots + Super combo. It's very important to keep tabs on every Brawler that you hit as well so that you can optimize your damage output based on their healing patterns.
    Colette is a very strong Brawler in Heist. The heist safe counts as a special target to Colette, meaning that at max level she can do 2800 damage per hit with her Super, effectively dealing 5600 damage or 13% to the heist safe with one Super. She can also recharge her Super to use again if she hits defending enemies along with the safe. Combined with her fast Super charge rate and Mass Tax Star Power, she can repeatedly Super the Heist safe, gaining even more protection from the Star Power. Her Push It Star Power is also useful; it can push enemies away from the safe while defending, and push defending enemies away when attacking the enemy safe (allowing shorter-ranged Brawlers to offend easier).
    Colette also has an excellent synergy with Byron in Heist, as Colette can continuously get healed by Byron's attacks and Super while she repeatedly dashes into the safe with her own Super. This is even more effective if Colette uses her Mass Tax Star Power.
    Colette can use two attacks and her Na-ah! gadget to take out any target at or below 4283 HP, regardless of their maximum health. This allows her to easily take out Brawlers that normally counter her such as Surge without the assistance of teammates. <br><br><br><br><br>

Colonel Ruffs is a Chromatic Brawler who could be unlocked as a Tier 30 reward in Season 5: The Starr Force! Brawl Pass, or can be obtained from Brawl Boxes after reaching Tier 30 in the Season 5 Brawl Pass. He has moderate damage and a fast reload speed, but has relatively low health. He attacks by firing two parallel lasers that bounce off walls and deal damage to enemies. With his Super, he calls a supply drop from the sky, which deals damage to enemies and leaves behind a power-up on the ground. Upon picking up the power-up, allies gain a damage boost as well as additional maximum health. His Gadget, Take Cover, spawns three sandbags that block non-piercing enemy fire. His first Star Power, Air Superiority, allows his Super to destroy obstacles and deal more damage. His second Star Power, Field Promotion, increases the maximum health of allies near Ruffs every second.

Attack: Double-Barrel Laser
"Ruffs' twin-laser bounces off walls multiple times. They can hit enemies behind cover."

Colonel Ruffs fires two lasers simultaneously parallel to each other. They can bounce off of walls, increasing their range by 1 tile up to 3 times, similarly to Rico's attack. Each laser's bounce is independent of the other.
Super: Supply Drop
"Ruffs calls upon a supply drop that can damage enemies in the landing area and leaves a power-up for friendly brawlers to pick up. The power-up increases health and damage. It does not stack and is lost on death."

Colonel Ruffs throws a beacon that summons a supply drop after a short second delay. An indicator shows the area-of-effect of the supply drop that damages and knocks back enemies inside the area-of-effect when it lands. A power-up in the shape of a small badge appears, which both Colonel Ruffs and allies can pick up, boosting their attack damage (and healing and Super damage if applicable) by 20% and their maximum health by 700 health (and instantly healing them by 700 health in the process). Only one power-up at a time can be active on the field, and using your Super again when there is already a power-up on the field will remove the power up currently on the field. However, there can be multiple buffed teammates.

Buffed allies will glow a pinkish-purple tone, regardless of any Brawler. These buffs stack additively with other buffs other than Ruff's power-up, like Power Cubes and 8-BIT‘s Super. These buffs disappear when allies are defeated, a round is over in Knockout, or a goal is scored in Brawl Ball. However, this doesn’t affect Gadgets or Star Powers such as Brock's Incendiary Star Power.
Gadget: Take Cover
"Ruffs throws down 3 sandbags to cover himself. Each one has 2000 health."

Colonel Ruffs spawns three immobile sandbags in a triangle formation around him, each having 2000 health. They block non-piercing or bouncing/splitting narrow enemy fire. Auto-aim prioritizes enemies over the sandbags.
Star Powers
Air Superiority
"Supply Drop now includes a bomb that adds +1000 damage to the drop and also allows it to destroy walls."

Ruffs' Super now deals an additional 1000 damage (total 2400) to hit enemies and destroys obstacles.
Field Promotion
"Friendly Brawlers have their maximum health increased by 30 every second they are in range of this ability while it's active. "

Colonel Ruffs raises all allied Brawlers' maximum health in a 3.33 tile radius around him by 30 health per second. This doesn’t apply to Colonel Ruffs himself, and if any affected allies die, their maximum health is reset. This Star Power will reveal the location of Colonel Ruffs.
Tips

    When aiming Ruffs' Super, try to aim it near a place where allies can obtain the power-up fairly easily and where enemies are knocked back. This can be ignored in Solo Showdown or Lone Star after you get your first boost; instead, use his Super for area denial or a knockback. In both Solo and Team events, getting your Super quickly is essential.
    Ruffs' attacks can be utilized like Rico's attacks since they bounce off walls, and his attack shoots two projectiles, so he can hit enemies without coming under fire himself due to his relatively low health. This can be handy when playing in maps with many walls, such as Cavern Churn. In order maximize your chances of hitting the enemy with both of your shots, utilize manual aim wherever possible. If you aim correctly, Ruffs can offer a lot of offensive power. His Double-Barrel Laser can deal moderate damage as well as his Super. The offensive power of Colonel Ruffs increases if he is buffed by a power-up or using his Air Superiority Star Power.
    If you are in danger, use the Take Cover Gadget, as he is able to protect himself (and allies) while being able to shoot over the sandbags. The sandbags won’t protect against piercing attacks or bouncing attacks though (even less so against Penny, Surge, Belle, or Jessie) so be cautious when a Brawler with such attacks comes at you.
    In any mode with teammates, make sure each of your allies receive a power-up from Ruffs' Super, allowing you and your team to have an advantage. The immediate heal from a power-up offers some protection to low-health Brawlers. If the teammate in question is not behind cover, saving a power-up for more vital situations is more effective. If you have a Super ready and everyone on the team is buffed by it (they've all picked up a power-up each), you may also throw the Super near your team's respawn point, so that should someone get defeated, they can immediately pick up a power-up and get back into action.
    His Field Promotion Star Power is very good in Duo Showdown. Standing near high-health Brawlers like Frank and El Primo can drastically increase their health, which will help in later game. However, the boosted health is circumvented by Colette due to her increasing damage with more health. It can also be used in Bounty to help lower-health Brawlers like Tick to survive at least one more attack.
    Colonel Ruffs' Super’s Air Superiority Star Power can break obstacles and defeat enemies quicker, and even without the Star Power, Ruffs' Super can be used over walls to attack enemies behind cover, in which his Super be very useful while playing Brawl Ball. You’ll want to use Air Superiority rather than Field Promotion in Brawl Ball unless you don't have the former because you won't often be near your teammates in this event (due to the dangers of team-wiping) and the slow action of this Star Power won’t be quick enough in a fast-moving event like Brawl Ball, unlike in slower-moving events like Bounty and Duo Showdown. Also, you cannot miss the advantages of Air Superiority (to break walls and team-wipe the opposition) for the other 's rather ineffective power. It’s also vital to note that after scoring a goal, power-ups are lost so power-ups may not be very useful, but his Air Superiority Star Power is still beneficial as it can knock enemies from the ball and destroy cover (especially goal barriers), so you need to strategically aim your Super to give extra benefit.
    An interesting use of Ruff's Field Promotion Star Power in Heist is to camp near your spawn area with both teammates for about 1 minute. If the enemy team tries to attack, the offensive power of your teammates will easily defend the safe. Moreover, camping for 1 minute will give an advantage of 1800+ health. Paired with the 700 health and damage buff from Ruff's power-up, it can increase the health of low-health Brawlers like Tick and Crow to around 6000 health, making them even more difficult to counter. <br><br><br><br><br>

Gale is a Chromatic Brawler who could be unlocked as a Brawl Pass reward at Tier 30 from Season 1: Tara's Bazaar or can be unlocked from Brawl Boxes. He has moderate health and damage, and a great attack consistency due to his fast reload speed and short attack cooldown. Gale attacks with waves of damaging snowballs. With his Super, Gale creates a wide and long-ranged gust of wind and snow that pushes back enemies. His Gadget, Spring Ejector, spawns a launch pad beneath himself that can launch any target. His first Star Power, Blustery Blow, causes enemies who are pushed back into obstacles to become momentarily stunned. His second Star Power, Freezing Snow, briefly slows enemies hit by his main attack.

Attack: Polar Vortex
"Gale blasts a large snow ball wall at his enemies!"

Gale fires 6 long-ranged snowballs which travel in a straight and wide line, each dealing low damage. The snowballs are fired directly next to each other and have an immediate spread. Unlike many Brawlers who shoot multiple bullets at once, Gale can’t deal maximum damage at point-blank range due to this immediate spread, but as a result it's easier for him to sweep bushes and hit multiple enemies.
Super: Gale Force!
"Gale delivers an almighty gust of wind and snow, pushing back all enemies caught in its path."

Gale's Super creates a long and wide wind-like projectile of wind and snow that passes through obstacles and lakes. It pushes away and slightly damages enemies it hits.
Gadget: Spring Ejector
"Gale drops a bounce pad underfoot, launching friend and foe alike into the air."

Upon activation, a launch pad is spawned below him, launching him in the direction in which he is faced. Similar to regular launch pads, it also launches deployables and enemies. Note that the pad can be hidden within bushes, and has an indefinite duration. However, the pad disappears after a goal is scored in Brawl Ball, a point is scored in Volley Brawl or Basket Brawl, a round is over in Knockout, or if Gale uses his Gadget again to spawn another launch pad. If the launch pad launches a player with the ball in Brawl Ball, they’ll drop the ball. Gale’s launch pads have a launching power of 6 tiles, unlike regular launch pads, which have a launching power of 12 tiles, and they’re yellow in appearance.

Blustery Blow
"Gale's Super now stuns enemies for 1.0 seconds if they are pushed against obstacles from his Super."

If Gale's Super pushes enemies into any obstacle, they’ll be stunned for 1 second.

"Gale's snow balls now also slow down opponents for 0.5 seconds. "

When Gale's main attack hits an enemy, they’ll be slowed down for 0.5 seconds.
Tips

    Gale has mainly everything a Brawler would require: decent health, decent damage, long range, a fast reload speed, a reasonable movement speed, and support abilities such as his Super and his Spring Ejector Gadget, and he finds use in every game mode, similar to 8-BIT. Some of the modes he excels at most are control-based events like Hot Zone, Brawl Ball, Gem Grab, and Siege where pushing back enemies helps his team gain control of important areas such as the zones, the goalposts, the Gem mine, and the Bolts in each respective game mode.
    A maximum of 4 snowballs hit targets with normal-sized hitboxes like Brawlers and the Heist safe at a relatively close range unless the target moves considerably, as the snowballs do not originate from the center of the attack.
    Gale's Super allows him to displace enemies into his favor, depending on the situation. He can either push them away from him and his team to save him and them (especially from close-ranged attacks) or push the enemy team into his, allowing for allied close-ranged Brawlers to deal more damage. He can also use his Super’s knockback to interrupt dangerous Supers such as Frank‘s Super.
    Gale's Super, Spring Ejector Gadget or a combination of the two can be used to push enemies into the poison clouds in Showdown/Duo Showdown. This is especially useful in Cavern Churn as an enemy pushed into the poison clouds in this map may have to cross mazes of walls to get back into the safe zone, allowing them to take a lot of damage. This usually secures a defeat in the case of low-medium health Brawlers. He can also use his Super in Showdown or Lone Star to push enemies into other enemies, and in Showdown, Lone Star, and Knockout, he can get chip away at enemies easily due to his fast reload speed and attack cooldown and defeat them. He can also use his Spring Ejector Gadget to make a quick getaway when he is in danger.
    Be careful when facing Emz or Piper as they deal more damage the further away their target is. In some situations, using Gale’s Super on them inadvertently allows them to deal massive damage to you, so it’s better to push them when behind walls, into walls with Blustery Blow, or into other enemies or into the poison clouds in Showdown. However, if Gale is near them, he should quickly eliminate them and ignore a charged Super, because both the Brawlers deal mediocre damage at close range and won't be a match for Gale.
    Gale's support abilities truly shine in events like Gem Grab and Bounty where he should use his Super to protect the Gem or Star carrier from approaching enemy tanks and other high-damaging enemies by pushing them back a considerable distance. He may also push enemies away from the Gem mine, allow for control of it and collecting Gems at ease.
    Gale is also useful for Heist and Siege. One of the best ways to use Gale's Spring Ejector Gadget in these events is to position the launch pad in such a way that when Gale and fellow Brawlers use it, they are able to reach the other team's safe or IKE. Make sure to change the position of the launch pad every so often in order to make it more unpredictable as to where allies will land. Also, if Gale is the protector of his and team’s safe or IKE, he can push enemies away from his and his team’s safe or IKE in a direction that the enemies will be far from their safe or IKE as well, buying more time for his teammates to defeat the enemies’ safe or IKE; He can consistently attack the enemy IKE or safe, helping his teammates. He can also push enemies away from the Bolts, or slow them down from receiving Bolts with the Freezing Snow Star Power, allowing for teammates to get a Siege Bot quickly.
    Gale can be a great asset to any Brawl Ball or Trophy Thieves team, as his Spring Ejector Gadget can help get his teammates back into action by placing it at the foot of his goal or trophy area, and his Super can knock the Ball or trophy out of a carrier's grasp, while blowing them away from the ball or trophy. Gale's Super also affects the landing position of the respective item if it’s being carried which allows him to potentially score goals within 3 tiles away from the enemy goal or shoot the trophy into the trophy area.
    Gale is an outstanding control Brawler for Hot Zone. His Super pushes enemy Brawlers back, giving time for teammates to heal up and for allies to deal damage. This allows for more capturing of the hot zone(s) while the enemies have to make their way back. This is most useful in maps where there is a single hot zone in the center (i.e. Dueling Beetles and Ring of Fire). Gale’s Spring Ejector Gadget is also a valuable help, as the launch pad can allow allies to reach zones quicker and providing a solid defense in the zone.
    Gale is not a bad choice in Boss Fight and Super City Rampage since the Boss's and the Monster's hitboxes are larger than normal, so all 6 snowballs from Gale's attack will hit, dealing more damage than usual. At maximum level, his snowballs can deal up to 2352 damage, and he can deal damage consistently. His Super is also useful to cancel out the Boss's or Monster's special attacks, especially with his Blustery Blow Star Power so you can stun them, or to distance yourself from them when they are using their melee attacks on you or chasing you when both teammates are dead. You can also use his Freezing Snow Star Power on the Mega Monster to buy time to defeat it.
    A combination of Gale's Super with his Blustery Blow Star Power and three main attacks (assuming that four projectiles hit per attack) can guarantee defeat to an enemy with 5040 or less health.
    Gale is a decent choice in Big Game because as the Big Boss, he can push enemies away from him, and with his Blustery Blow Star Power, he can stun the Hunters, though Blustery Blow is only effective when he is the Big Boss, as stuns are ineffective against the Big Boss. As a Hunter, he can place his Spring Ejector Gadget to allow close-ranged Hunters to circumvent obstacles or allow other Hunters to get back into action faster after being defeated, and he can slow the Big Boss with his Freezing Snow Star Power. Since the Big Boss has an extremely large hitbox, all of the snowballs will hit, dealing massive damage. If long-ranged Brawlers are on his team, he can push the Big Boss far, allowing them to deal massive damage.
    When vulnerable enemies are hiding behind a one or two tile thick wall, Gale can use his Super to push them away from them the wall and then defeat them.
    Gale with his Freezing Snow Star Power can limit enemy's starfing abilities and also force groups of Brawlers to group up to defeat Gale together by slowing them down, thus allowing splash-damage teammates or allies with piercing mechanics to easily perform a team-wipe. <br><br><br><br><br>

Lou is a Chromatic Brawler that could be unlocked as a Brawl Pass reward at Tier 30 from Season 4: Holiday Getaway or can be unlocked from Brawl Boxes after reaching Tier 30 in the Season 4 Brawl Pass. Lou has moderate health and damage, and has immense utility in both his attack and Super. Lou attacks by throwing snow cones at enemies, which applies Frost that fills their Frost meter. Fully filling an enemy's Frost meter briefly stuns them. His Super creates a fairly large area of ice that slows down enemies and makes maneuvering harder. His Gadget, Ice Block, makes him immobile but invulnerable momentarily. His first Star Power, Supercool, fills enemies' Frost meter when they’re inside Lou's Super’s area-of-effect. His second Star Power, Hypothermia, decreases enemies' reload speed depending on their Frost. Lou throws 3 long-ranged snow cones in a straight line in quick succession. They deal low damage each but moderate damage when all three snow cone hit. After hitting any opposing enemy with even just one snow cone, a Frost meter appears to the left of the enemy's name, or if not a Brawler, to the left of the health bar. Each snow cone applies the same Frost percentage as his Super charge rate, which is 15.73%. After the Frost meter is filled up, the enemy freezes in place for 1.5 seconds. If Frost isn’t applied for 2 seconds, the Frost meter begins to deplete by 5% every second. Frost can stack with multiple Lous. This attack takes 0.45 seconds to complete.

"Lou lobs a can of freezing cold syrup that creates an icy, slippery area on the ground. Very tough for his opponents' fancy footwork!"

Lou lobs snow cone syrup over obstacles and creates a icy, slippery area on the ground. Any enemy who changes direction while moving on the area will have difficulty maneuvering, similar to slipping on ice. This doesn’t affect Lou or his allies. The slippery area also deals minimal amounts of damage every second to enemies who are inside it, preventing healing.
Gadget: Ice Block
"Lou shields himself with ice, becoming invulnerable for 1.0 seconds."

Lou becomes completely immobile but impervious to all damage for 1 second aside from knockbacks, pulls, and stuns.
Star Powers
Supercool
"Opponents standing on Lou's Super area get gradually frozen, like from his Brain Freeze attack."

Lou's Super now gradually applies 14% Frost every second onto enemies. This effect stacks with his regular attack, so an enemy standing in the ice who is attacked by Lou gets frozen quickly.
Hypothermia
"Opponents lose up to 75% of their reload speed based on how frozen they are from Lou's attacks."

Enemies lose 5% of their reload speed for every tick of Frost up to 75%. This maxes at 75% Frost or roughly 5 attacks.
Tips

    Lou's Frost can freeze the enemy team, in which while playing certain 3v3 modes like Gem Grab, this can give Lou and his team an advantage. In Gem Grab, he can freeze the enemy Gem Carrier, and the Gem Carrier will be prone to defeat. With his Super (on the Gem mine) and his Supercool Star Power, collecting Gems for enemies will be slowed drastically while allowing Lou and his allies to collect Gems with ease because enemies are more vulnerable to being stunned and defeated while on the Gem mine.
    His Super can completely cover zones in Hot Zone. He can use this to his and team’s advantage as enemies can’t enter the hot zones without slowing down and being quickly defeated with ease from Lou and his teammates.
    Since his Super makes enemies slow down and makes maneuvering harder, enemies will attempt to escape by moving in the same direction, which makes attacks easier to hit and enemy movement to be predictable. With his Supercool Star Power, this is better justified and is more frivolous to enemies, because if they’re stacked with the attacks and Super, they’ll be quickly stunned and defeated, not to mention they’ll also have trouble maneuvering. Additively, the more speed a Brawler has, the more struggle they have changing directions in Lou's Super. This makes Lou an ideal counter to speedy Brawlers like tanks, Max, and Mortis.
    Lou has a great synergy with Edgar and other close-ranged Brawlers. Lou can stun and slow the enemies with his attack and Super (more effective with his Supercool Star Power), and the respective close-ranged Brawler can jump onto or ambush the affected enemies and quickly defeat them.
    Lou can stun enemies easily with 3 shots, which is useful in Showdown, Duo Showdown, Bounty, or Lone Star, because he can quickly defeat enemies or quickly escape if he’s in danger.
    Lou can be powerful in Brawl Ball or Trophy Thieves because his attack stuns enemies, making them drop the Ball/trophy with 3 shots.
    In Special Events such as Boss Fight, Robo Rumble or Super City Rampage, similarly to Bibi, Lou can apply Frost and stun the robots/Boss/Mega Monster and cancel out an attack being performed, and with Lou's fast reload speed and unload speed, he can do this consistently. With his Super, he can also slow the respective enemies down, as it’ll struggle to move or launch an attack. These few extra seconds from stunning the Boss can affect the outcome of the match drastically.
    Lou is also useful in Siege, as the stunning method also works when defending or offending. He can stun the enemy Siege Robot and prevent it from moving. He can also stun the enemy IKE, allowing teammates to destroy the IKE with ease.
    Lou should use his Ice Block Gadget mainly to avoid high-damaging projectiles, like the Supers of Nani and Dynamike, or the potentially deadly long-range projectiles of the Boss in Boss Fight if Lou or his teammates are low on health and need to escape, or if Lou is the last teammate alive, and not to use it with low-damaging projectiles or melee attacks, because he is immobile during the Gadget’s usage.
    Lou’s Frost is already devastating to enemies because it stuns them, but with his Hypothermia Star Power, the enemies’ attacks will be extremely ineffective, because enemies lose their reload speed and they’ll also be frozen.
    When escaping an enemy Lou's Super, if possible, it’s almost always better to turn lightly, up to 90 degrees, instead of making a U-turn as the deceleration would be limited by Lou's Super.
    Despite his stuns being ineffective against the boss, Lou is still decent in Big Game as a Hunter because he can keep dealing damage to the Boss with his long range, fast reload speed, Super, and reliable damage. He is more useful as the Big Boss, as he can repeatedly stun the Hunters and prevent them from attacking him. He can also use his Super to slow down grouped-up enemies. Coupled with his fast reload speed, his attacks, and his Super, he can prove devastating to the Hunters. <br><br><br><br><br>

Surge is a Chromatic Brawler who could be unlocked as a Brawl Pass reward at Tier 30 from Season 2: Summer of Monsters or can be unlocked from Brawl Boxes. He has low health but a moderately high damage output and high burst damage as he can fire his attacks rather quickly. His main attack fires a shot of juice that splits upon hitting an enemy. His Super is a jump in the air that lands him in his original position, dealing damage and knocking enemies back, and also granting him various upgrades to his attacks and movement speed. His Gadget, Power Surge, teleports Surge a short distance through obstacles in the direction he is facing. His first Star Power, To the Max! allows his projectiles to split into 2 when hitting a wall(Or if he is fully maxed, 6 shots). Surge's second Star Power, Serve Ice Cold, makes Surge respawn with his Stage 1 upgrade instead of reverting back to his initial state.

Attack: Juice of Justice
"Surge serves a shot of Juice that splits in two on contact with enemies."

Surge fires a shot that splits in two at right angles when it hits an enemy. Each of the split shots will deal half the damage and half the Super charge of the initial shot. When upgraded to Stage 2 with his Super, Surge's attack range increases. Likewise, his attack splits into 6 projectiles instead of 2 with the additional Stage 3 upgrade, with 3 projectiles firing in a wide arc on each side. These split shots continue on their trail for an additional 4 tiles. His attack has a short cooldown, but reloads slowly.
Super: Party Tricks
"With each Super, Surge gets upgraded (MAX 3). Upgrades are lost when Surge is defeated."

Surge flies up into the air, knocking enemies back and dealing damage in a small radius upon landing. While in the air, Surge is completely immune to all damage besides status effects and damage applied over time. In addition, Surge becomes upgraded, along with an altered appearance, each time he uses his Super. Surge's upgrades reset if he is defeated, a round is over a Knockout, or if a goal is scored in Brawl Ball. Additionally, a military-like rank icon will appear beside his health bar that represents his current upgrade stage. This icon can be seen by Surge's teammates and enemies.
STAGE 	Appearance 	Upgrade
Surge Stage1-Icon.png 	Surge New.png 	Default
Surge Stage2-Icon.png 	Surge Stage2 Skin-Default.png 	Boosted movement speed to 820 (Very Fast)
Surge Stage3-Icon.png 	Surge Stage3 Skin-Default.png 	Increased attack range by 2 tiles
Surge Stage4-Icon.png 	Surge Stage4 Skin-Default.png 	Main attack splits into 6 projectiles (from 2)
Gadget: Power Surge
"Surge overloads his circuits and teleports a short distance forward."

Surge instantly teleports up to 3 tiles in the direction he is facing. He can teleport through obstacles, however, if more than 3 tiles is required to bypass an obstacle, Surge will teleport only the 3 tiles forward, but not through the obstacle. Surge can’t be damaged while teleporting, but he retains status effects.
Star Powers
To the Max!
"Surge's main attack now splits when hitting walls."

Surge's main attack now also splits into 2 (or 6 if he's at Stage 4) if it hits an obstacle, such as walls and map borders.
Serve Ice Cold
"Surge keeps his STAGE 1 Super upgrade for the full match duration."

After using one Super, Surge will respawn with his Stage 1 upgrade (increased movement speed) instead of reverting back to his inital Stage if he gets defeated.
Tips

    Surge does not function well without his first upgrade. As a Surge player, if you don't have his second Star Power, Serve Ice Cold, charge up your Super as soon as you can and use it to get the speed he needs to make up for his rather short range. Don't be hesitant to use his Super for need of a defensive tool, as without his first upgrade, Surge lacks any offensive ability due to his slow speed and short range. After getting his first upgrade, you may either save his Super if you're playing against assassins or heavyweights who could ambush you at close range, or use it immediately if you're playing against longer ranged Brawlers who are out-ranging you. In Showdown try getting his second upgrade too, as he will need it to match Sharpshooters in more open maps. An effective Duo Showdown combination would be Surge and Bo as Bo can drop his Super Totem to charge up Surge's Super multiple times and allow Surge to get his much needed upgrades.
    When Surge's Super is activated, he can momentarily dodge any projectiles approaching him. Use his Super at just the right moment to avoid a potentially devastating attack; for example, Surge can evade Frank's destructive Super by just activating his Super right after Frank swings his hammer. Alternatively, his Super can be used when fighting close range against an enemy, as landing his Super on an enemy within a small radius does damage and also produces a knock-back effect. If a close range heavyweight is chasing Surge, the Super can be used to physically distance Surge from his enemy and to deter the enemy brawler from further confrontation by dishing out some extra damage.
    Once he reaches STAGE 3, Surge's Super should not be used immediately after charging it. It will not upgrade him any further, so it is a better idea to keep it charged until he needs it. It can later be used when he needs to dodge attacks or when a Brawler gets too close.
        In Showdown, try saving your Super even if you're not at STAGE 3. Surge's Super is a vital tool for him to survive in Showdown especially if you're up against Assassins and other brawlers that can get dangerously close to you. Also, his attack splitting into 6 is not very useful in the event as you'll mostly be fighting 1v1, unlike in 3v3 where hitting multiple enemies is useful and more common.
    At his initial stage, Surge is an easy target for throwers. Staying out of range or simply avoiding throwers increases Surge's chance of survival until he reaches stage 1. After upgrading himself for the first time, Surge can counter their attacks with his very fast movement speed which quickly turns him into a threat.
    In 3v3 events, such as Brawl Ball, conserving a charged Super until after respawn can provide a vital speed boost immediately after Surge is able to rejoin in the action. Speed is also required in Brawl Ball to get goals.
    His Power Surge Gadget can be used for a quick escape or dodge by teleporting behind a wall/through the attack and staying behind it for cover. It's also extremely effective for offensive maneuvers. When facing Brawlers on low health or a thrower such as Dynamike behind a wall or obstacle, he can use his Gadget to teleport through it and finish them off. The speed of his teleportation often surprises enemies, giving Surge an extra advantage over his enemy. A great way to use his Gadget effectively in Showdown is to teleport onto enemy Brawlers that Surge can reliably burst down. Use the Gadget to get in range of a Brawler that Surge can defeat with three shots. All three main shots are enough to charge Surge's next Super. His Gadget can also be used in combination with his Super by first teleporting onto an enemy, then immediately activating his Super. This will most likely waste enemy ammunition while also dishing out extra damage, knocking the enemy back, and charging Surge's next Super by about a third.
    Surge's To the Max! Star Power is particularly effective in Showdown. On certain Showdown maps such as Rockwall Brawl and Cavern Churn, there are long lanes and cramped walls that Surge can utilize to split his shots. To the Max! is extremely powerful if Surge is fully upgraded, as his shots split into 6 instead of 2, making him an immediate threat combined with his high burst damage and gadget.
        His Serve Ice Cold Star Power is completely useless in Solo Showdown and dubious in Duo Showdown, because it is only activated once Surge is defeated. To the Max! gives better value overall because the split shots from hitting a wall can help aid Surge gain his Super quickly without having to use his Gadgets to gain his pivotal upgrades.
    When fighting another Brawler as Surge, it's extremely important to consider what options they have to counter you. Surge is best played when he can achieve easy kills with 3 ammo but Surge himself is somewhat low-health. Playing Surge opportunistically and making calculated decisions especially with his Power Surge Gadget results in Surge being very fearsome to fight against. Get close enough to enemies and only then attack, as Surge reloads painfully slow and has low health, so wasting attacks should be avoided.
    When being ambushed close-range by an assassin, Surge can use both his Power Surge Gadget and Party Tricks Super to dodge their attacks. <br><br><br><br><br>
